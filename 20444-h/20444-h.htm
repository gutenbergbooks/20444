		<h2 class="title">WHAT IS TRANSCENDENTALISM?</h2>
		<h3 class="byline">BY A THINKING MAN.</h3>
		<p><span class="first_word">This</span> question has often been asked but seldom answered satisfactorily.
		Newspaper editors and correspondents have frequently attempted a practical
		elucidation of the mystery, by quoting from their own brains the
		rarest piece of absurdity which they could imagine, and entitling it
		&#8216;Transcendentalism.&#8217; One good hit of this kind may be well enough,
		by way of satire upon the fogginess of certain writers who deem themselves,
		and are deemed by the multitude, transcendental <i>par excellence</i>.
		<span class="special_name">Coleridge</span> however thought that to parody stupidity by way of ridiculing
		it, only proves the parodist more stupid than the original blockhead.
		Still, one such attempt may be tolerated; but when imitators of the
		parodist arise and fill almost every newspaper in the country with similar
		witticisms, such efforts become &#8216;flat and unprofitable;&#8217; for nothing is
		easier than to put words together in a form which conveys no meaning
		to the reader. It is a cheap kind of wit, asinine rather than attic, and
		can be exercised as well by those who know nothing of the subject as
		by those best acquainted with it. Indeed, it is greatly to be doubted
		whether one in a hundred of these witty persons know any thing of the
		matter; for if they possess sense enough to make them worthy of being
		ranked among reasonable men, it could be proved to them in five minutes
		that they are themselves transcendentalists, as all thinking men find
		themselves compelled to be, whether they know themselves by that name
		or not.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Poh!&#8217; said a friend, looking over my shoulder; &#8216;you can&#8217;t prove <em>me</em>
		a transcendentalist; I defy you to do it; I despise the name.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Why so? Let us know what it is that you despise. Is it the sound of
		the word? Is it not sufficiently euphonious? Does it not strike your
		ear as smoothly as Puseyite, or Presbyterian?</p>

		<p>&#8216;Nonsense!&#8217; said he; &#8216;you don&#8217;t suppose I am to be misled by the
		sound of a word; it is the meaning to which I object. I despise transcendentalism;
		therefore I do not wish to be called transcendentalist.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>206</span>Very well; but we shall never &#8216;get ahead&#8217; unless you define transcendentalism
		according to your understanding of the word.</p>

		<p>&#8216;That request is easily made, but not easily complied with. Have
		you Carlyle or Emerson at hand?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Here I took down a volume of each, and read various sentences and
		paragraphs therefrom. These passages are full of transcendental
		ideas; do you object to them?</p>

		<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said my friend; &#8216;for aught I can perceive, they might have
		been uttered by any one who was <em>not</em> a transcendentalist. Let me see
		the books.&#8217;</p>

		<p>After turning over the leaves a long while, he selected and read aloud
		a passage from Carlyle, one of his very worst; abrupt, nervous, jerking,
		and at the same time windy, long-drawn-out, and parenthetical; a period
		filling a whole page.</p>

		<p>&#8216;There,&#8217; said he, stopping to take breath, &#8216;if that is not enough to disgust
		one with transcendentalism, then I know nothing of the matter.&#8217;</p>

		<p>A very sensible conclusion. Bless your soul, that is <em>Carlyle-ism</em>, not
		transcendentalism. You said but now that you were not to be misled
		by the sound of a word; and yet you are condemning a principle on account
		of the bad style of a writer who is supposed to be governed by it.
		Is that right? Would you condemn Christianity because of the weaknesses
		and sins of one of its professors?</p>

		<p>&#8216;Of course not,&#8217; replied he; &#8216;I wish to be fair. I cannot express my
		idea of the meaning of transcendentalism without tedious circumlocution,
		and I begin to despair of proving my position by quotations. It is not
		on any particular passage that I rest my case. You have read this
		work, and will understand me when I say that it is to its general intent
		and spirit that I object, and not merely to the author&#8217;s style.&#8217;</p>

		<p>I think I comprehend you. You disregard the mere form in which
		the author expresses his thoughts; you go beyond and behind that, and
		judge him by the thoughts themselves; not by one or by two, but by the
		sum and <em>substance</em> of the whole. You strip off the husk to arrive at the
		kernel, and judge of the goodness of the crop by the latter, not the
		former.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Just so,&#8217; said he; &#8216;that&#8217;s my meaning precisely. I always strive
		to follow that rule in every thing. &#8216;Appearances,&#8217; you know, &#8216;are deceitful.&#8217;&#8217;</p>

		<p>That is to say, you go beyond or transcend appearances and circumstances,
		and divine the true meaning, the substance, the spirit of that on
		which you are about to decide. That is practical transcendentalism,
		and you are a transcendentalist.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I wish you would suggest another name for it,&#8217; said my friend, as he
		went out of the door; &#8216;I detest the sound of that word.&#8217;</p>

		<p>I wish we could, said I, but he was out of hearing; I wish we could,
		for it is an abominably long word to write.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I wish we could,&#8217; mutters the printer, &#8216;for it is an awfully long word
		to print.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I wish we could,&#8217; is the sober second thought of all; for people will
		always condemn transcendentalism until it is called by another name.
		Such is the force of prejudice.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>207</span>&#8216;I have been thinking over our conversation of yesterday,&#8217; said my
		friend next morning, on entering my room.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Oh, you have been writing it down, have you? Let me see it.&#8217;
		After looking over the sketch, he remarked:</p>

		<p>&#8216;You <em>seem</em> to have me fast enough, but after all I believe you conquered
		merely by playing upon a word, and in proving me to be a transcendentalist
		you only proved me to be a reasonable being; one capable
		of perceiving, remembering, combining, comparing and deducing; one
		who, amid the apparent contradictions with which we are surrounded,
		strives to reconcile appearances and discover principles; and from the
		outward and visible learn the inward and spiritual; in fine, arrive at
		truth. Now every reasonable man claims to be all that I have avowed
		myself to be. If this is to be a transcendentalist, then I am one. When
		I read that I must hate my father and mother before I can be a disciple
		of <span class="special_name">Jesus</span>, I do not understand that passage literally; I call to mind other
		precepts of <span class="special_name">Christ</span>; I remember the peculiarities of eastern style; I
		compare these facts together, and deduce therefrom a very different
		principle from that apparently embodied in the passage quoted. When
		I see the Isle of Shoals doubled, and the duplicates reversed in the air
		above the old familiar rocks, I do not, as I stand on Rye-beach, observing
		the interesting phenomenon, believe there are two sets of islands
		there; but recalling facts which I have learned, and philosophical truths
		which I have acquired and verified, I attribute the appearance to its
		true cause, refraction of light. When in passing from room to room in
		the dark, with my arms outspread, I run my nose against the edge of a
		door, I do not therefrom conclude that my nose is longer than my arms!
		When I see a man stumble in the street, I do not at once set him down
		as a drunkard, not considering that to be sufficient evidence, although
		some of our Washingtonian friends do; but I compare that fact with the
		state of the streets, and what I know of his previous life, and judge accordingly.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Well, said I, you are an excellent transcendentalist; one after my
		own heart, in morals, philosophy and religion. To be a transcendentalist
		is after all to be <em>only</em> a sensible, unprejudiced man, open to conviction
		at all times, and spiritually-minded. I can well understand that,
		when you condemn transcendentalism, you object not to the principle,
		but to the practice, in the superlative degree, of that principle. Transcendentalism
		is but an abstract mode of considering morals, philosophy,
		religion; an application of the principles of abstract science to these
		subjects. All metaphysicians are transcendentalists, and every one is
		transcendental so far as he is metaphysical. There are as many different
		modifications of the one as of the other, and probably no two transcendentalists
		ever thought alike; their creed is not yet written. You
		certainly do not condemn spiritualism, but ultra spiritualism you seem
		to abhor.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Precisely so. I did not yesterday give you the meaning which I
		attached to transcendentalism; in truth, practically you meant one thing
		by that term, and I another, though I now see that in principle they are
		the same. The spiritualism which I like, looks through nature and
		revelation up to <span class="special_name">God</span>; that which I abhor, condescends hardly to make
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>208</span>use of nature at all, but demands direct converse with <span class="special_name">God</span>, and declares
		that it enjoys it too; a sort of continual and <em>immediate</em> revelation.
		Itself is its own authority. The ultra-spiritualist contains within himself
		the fulness of the Godhead. He allows of nothing external, unless
		it be brother spirits like himself. He has abolished nature, and to the
		uninitiated seems to have abolished <span class="special_name">God</span> himself, although I am charitable
		enough to believe that he has full faith in <span class="special_name">God</span>, after his own fashion.
		He claims to be inspired; to be equal to <span class="special_name">Jesus</span>; nay superior; for one
		of them lately said: &#8216;Greater is the container than the contained, therefore
		I am greater than <span class="special_name">God</span>, for I contain God!&#8217; The ultra-spiritualist
		believes only <em>by</em> and <em>through</em> and <em>in</em> his own inward light. Let him
		take care, as Carlyle says, that his own contemptible tar-link does not,
		by being held too near his eyes, extinguish to him the sun of the universe.
		Now the true spiritualist makes use not only of his own moral
		and religious instincts, but all that can be gathered by the senses from
		external nature, and all that can be acquired by untiring consultation
		with the sages who have gone before him; and from these materials in
		the alembic of his mind, with such power as <span class="special_name">God</span> has given him, he distils
		truth.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Truth! Ah, that is the very point in question. &#8216;What is truth?&#8217;
		has been the ardent inquiry of every honest mind from the days of
		Adam to the present time, and the sneering demand of many an unbeliever.
		Eve sought it when she tasted the forbidden fruit. But since
		then, thank <span class="special_name">God</span>! no prohibition has been uttered against the search
		after truth, and mankind have improved their liberty with great industry
		for six thousand years; and what is the result? Is truth discovered?
		How much? and how much of falsehood is mixed up with what <em>is</em>
		known to be true? These questions are constantly suggesting themselves
		to thinkers, and to answer them is the labor of their lives. Let
		them have free scope, ultra-spiritualists and all. Even these latter go
		through the same operation which you have just claimed to be peculiar
		to the true spiritualist. All do, whether they will or not, make use of
		observation, learning, and the inward light. Some arrive at one result,
		and some at another, because the elements differ in each. If any two
		could be found whose external observations, learning, intellect and inward
		light or instincts were precisely equal in volume and proportion,
		can it be doubted that these two would arrive at precisely similar results?
		But they are <em>not</em> equal; and so one comes to believe in external
		authority, and the other refers every thing to a standard which he thinks
		he finds within himself. The latter is deemed by the public to be a
		representative of pure transcendentalism, and he is condemned accordingly
		as self-sufficient.</p>

		<p>And privately, between you and me, my good friend, I cannot help
		thinking it rather ungrateful in him, after becoming so deeply indebted
		to his senses, to books, and the Bible for his spiritual education, to turn
		round and despise these means of advancement, and declare that they
		are mere non-essential <em>circumstances</em>, and that a man may reach the
		same end by studying himself <em>in</em> himself. It is as if a man should use
		a ladder to reach a lofty crag, and then kick it over contemptuously,
		and aver that he could just as well have flown up, and ask the crowd
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>209</span>below to break up that miserable ladder and try their wings. Doubtless
		they <em>have</em> wings, if they only knew it. But seriously, I am not inclined
		to join in the hue-and-cry against even the ultra-transcendentalist. He
		has truth mixed up with what I esteem objectionable, and some truth to
		which others have not attained; and as I deem the eclectic the only
		true mode of philosophy, I am willing to take truth where I can find it,
		whether in China or Boston, in Confucius or Emerson, Kant or Cousin,
		the Bible or the Koran; and though I have more reverence for one of
		these sources than all others, it is only because I think I find there the
		greatest amount of truth, sanctioned by the highest authority. To put
		the belief in the Bible on any other ground, is to base it on educational
		prejudice and superstition; on which principle the Koran should be as
		binding on the Mahometan as the Bible on us. Do we not all finally
		resort to <em>ourselves</em> in order to decide a difficult question in morals or religion?
		and is not the decision more or less correct accordingly as we
		refer it to the better or to the baser portion of our nature?</p>

		<p>&#8216;Most certainly! I have often said I would not and could not believe
		in the Bible, if it commanded us to worship Sin and leave our passions
		unbridled.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Well said! And in so saying, you acknowledge yourself to be governed
		by the same principle which actuates the ultra-transcendentalist;
		the moral sense or instinct, similar to the &#8216;inward light&#8217; of the Friends.
		After all, I apprehend the true point in which men differ is, whether
		this moral sense is really an instinct, or whether it is evolved and put
		in operation by education. How much is due to nature? is the true
		question. But to solve it, is important only theoretically, for practically
		we all act alike; we cannot, if we would, separate the educational from
		the natural moral sense; we cannot <em>uneducate</em> it, and then judge by it,
		freed from all circumstantial bias. But whether more or less indebted
		either to nature or education, it is to this moral and religious sense that
		the ultra-transcendentalist refers every question, and passes judgment
		according to its verdict. It is sometimes rather vaguely called the
		&#8216;Pure Reason;&#8217; but that is only a <em>term</em>, hardly a &#8216;mouthful of articulate
		wind.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;You and I shall agree very well together, I see,&#8217; replied my friend.
		&#8216;If we dispute at all, it will be foolishly about the meaning of a word.
		All the world have been doing that ever since the confusion of tongues
		at Babel. That great event prophetically shadowed forth the future;
		for now, as then, the confusion and disputation is greatest when we are
		striving most earnestly to reach heaven by our earth-built contrivances.
		We may draw a lesson therefrom; not to be too aspiring for our means;
		for our inevitable failure only makes us the more ridiculous, the higher
		the position we seem to have attained.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Very true; but we should never arrive at the height of wisdom,
		which consists in knowing our own ignorance and weakness, unless we
		made full trial of our powers. The fall of which you speak should
		give us a modesty not to be otherwise obtained, and make us very careful
		how we ridicule others, seeing how open to it we ourselves are. Every
		man may build his tower of Babel, and if he make a right use of his
		failure, may in the end be nearer heaven than if he had never made the
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>210</span>attempt. Ridicule is no argument, and should only be used by way of
		a <i>jeu d&#8217;esprit</i>, and never on solemn subjects. It is very hard, I know,
		for one who has mirthfulness strongly developed, to restrain himself on
		all occasions; and what is solemn to one may not be so to another;
		hence we should be very charitable to all; alike to the bigots, the
		dreamers, and the laughers; to the builders of theoretic Babel-towers,
		and the grovellers on the low earth.</p>

		<p>&#8216;There is one kind of transcendentalism,&#8217; replied my friend, &#8216;which
		you have not noticed particularly, which consists in believing in nothing
		except the spiritual existence of the unbeliever himself, and hardly that.
		It believes not in the external world at all.&#8217;</p>

		<p>If you are on <em>that</em> ground, I have done. To talk of that, would be
		wasting our time on nothing; or &#8216;our eternity,&#8217; for with that sect time
		is altogether a delusion. It <em>may</em> be true, but the believer, even in the
		act of declaring his faith, must practically prove himself persuaded of
		the falsity of his doctrine.</p>

		<p>&#8216;You wanted a short name for transcendentalism; if a long one
		will make <em>this</em> modification of it more odious, let us call it <em>Incomprehensibilityosityivityalityationmentnessism</em>.&#8217;</p>

		<p>My friend said this with a face nearly as long as the word, made a
		low bow, and departed. I took my pen and reduced our conversation
		to writing. I hope by this time the reader has a very lucid answer to
		give to the question, <i>What is Transcendentalism?</i> It will be a miracle
		if he can see one inch farther into the fog-bank than before. I should
		like to take back the boast made in the beginning of this paper, that
		I could prove in five minutes any reasonable man a transcendentalist.
		My friend disconcerted my plan of battle, by taking command of the
		enemy&#8217;s forces, instead of allowing me to marshal them on paper to suit
		myself; and so a mere friendly joust ensued, instead of the utter demolition
		of my adversary, which I had intended.</p>

		<p>And this little circumstance has led me to think, what a miserable business
		controversialists would make of it, if each had his opponent looking
		over his shoulder, pointing out flaws in his arguments, suggesting untimely
		truths, and putting every possible impediment in the path of his
		logic; and if, moreover, he were obliged to mend every flaw, prove
		every such truth a falsehood, and remove every impediment before he
		could advance a step. Were such the case, how much less would there
		be of fine-spun theory and specious argument; how much more of
		practical truth! Always supposing the logical combatants did not lose
		their patience and resort to material means and knock-down arguments;
		of which, judging by the spirit sometimes manifested in theological controversies,
		there would really seem to be some danger. Oh! it is a
		very easy thing to sit in one&#8217;s study and demolish an opponent, who
		after all is generally no opponent at all, but only a man of straw, dressed
		up for the occasion with a few purposely-tattered shreds of the adversary&#8217;s

		<h2 class="title">THE ALMS HOUSE.</h2>

		<h3 class="byline">BY A NEW CONTRIBUTOR.</h3>


		<p><span class="first_word">It</span> is not my purpose in the following narrative to point out all the
		evils arising from the modern practice of relieving the wants of the
		poor and destitute which prevails in this country and in England, where
		the arm of the law compels that pittance which should be the voluntary
		donation of benevolence; one consequence of which system is, that the
		poor claim support as a <em>debt</em> due from society at large, and feel no gratitude
		toward any of the individuals paying the tax. The payer of the
		tax, on the other hand, feeling that he can claim no merit for surrendering
		that which is wrung from him by force, and expecting no thanks
		for the act, and knowing that in many cases it operates as a bounty on
		idleness, hates the ungrateful burthen thus imposed upon him, and strives
		to reduce it to the least possible amount. In this way the ties which
		should bind together the poor and the rich are sundered. The benevolence
		of the patron and the gratitude of the dependent, which formerly
		existed, is changed to dislike and suspicion on the one part, and envy
		and ingratitude on the other.</p>

		<p>Doubtless one design of Providence in suffering want and misery to
		exist in the world, is that the benevolent virtues should be kept in exercise.
		He who was benevolence itself, seemed thus to think, when he
		said: &#8216;The poor ye have always with you.&#8217; But man in his selfishness
		virtually says: &#8216;The poor we will not have with us; we will put them
		out of our sight.&#8217; For in many towns in New-England, and probably
		in other States, it is customary to contract with some individual for their
		support; or, in other words, to sell them by auction, to him who will
		support them by the year, for the least sum per head. To illustrate
		some of the results of this system, the following incidents are related
		from memory, having been witnessed by me in my native place (an interior
		town in New-England) at an age when the feelings are most susceptible.
		And so deep was the impression then made on my mind, that
		I am enabled to vouch for the accuracy of the details.</p>

		<p>A meeting for the purpose of disposing of the poor of the town for
		the ensuing year was held at the house of the person who had kept
		them the previous year, (and where these unfortunates still were) as
		well because it was supposed he would again bid for them, as that those
		who wished to become competitors might ascertain their number and
		condition. It was in the afternoon of a day in November, one of those
		dark and dreary days so common to the season and climate, adding
		gloom to the surrounding objects, in themselves sufficiently cheerless.
		The house was situated on an obscure road in a remote part of the town,
		surrounded by level and sandy fields; and the monotony of the prospect
		only broken by scattered clumps of dwarf-pine and shrub-oak; a few
		stunted apple-trees, the remains of an orchard which the barren soil
		had refused to nourish; some half ruinous out-houses, and a meagre
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>213</span>kitchen garden enclosed with a common rough fence, completed the picture
		without.</p>

		<p>Still more depressing was the scene within. The paupers were collected
		in the same room with their more fortunate townsmen, that the
		bidders might be enabled to view more closely their condition, and
		estimate the probable expense of supporting them through the year.
		Many considerations entered as items into this sordid calculation; such
		as the very lowest amount of the very coarsest food which would suffice,
		(not to keep them in comfort, but to sustain their miserable existence
		for the next three hundred and sixty-five days, and yet screen the provider
		from the odium of having starved his victims,) the value of the
		clothes they then wore, and thus the future expense of their clothing;
		and other such considerations, which I will not farther disgust the reader
		by enumerating.</p>

		<p>They were about twenty in number, and not greatly distinguished
		from the ordinary poor of a country town in New-England; unless by
		there being present three idiot daughters of one poor man, whose low
		and narrow foreheads, sunken temples, fixed but dead and unmeaning
		eyes, half opened and formless mouths, indicating even to childhood
		the absence of that intellectual light, which in those who possess it
		shines through the features. Insanity also was there, that most dreadful
		infliction of Providence; the purpose of which lies hidden in the
		darkness which surrounds His throne. Its unhappy subject was with
		them, but not of them. His eyes were fixed upon the scene, but the
		uncertain fire which illumined his features was caused by thoughts
		which had no connection with the passing scene.</p>

		<p>Vice, too, had its representatives; for in a community where wealth
		is nearly the only source of distinction, and where Mammon is consequently
		worshipped as the true god, the destiny of the unfortunate and
		of the vicious is nearly the same. And the &#8216;poor-house&#8217; was used, as
		in other towns in New-England, as a house of correction, and at this
		time contained several professors of vice of each sex. Alas! of that
		sex which when corrupt is more dangerous than the other in a like condition,
		as the most rich and grateful things are in their decay the most
		noxious!</p>

		<p>The remaining number consisted of the aged and childless widow,
		the infirm and friendless old man, the sick, the deformed, and the cripple;
		the virtuous poor, in forced and loathed contact with vice and infamy.
		Those of society who in life&#8217;s voyage had been stranded on the bleak
		and barren coast of charity, and who were now waiting for death to
		float them into the ocean of eternity. While this scene was passing at
		the alms-house, another connected with it, and fitted to excite still
		deeper feelings, was acting in another part of the town.</p>

		<p>A person who was that year one of the select-men,<a href="#fn1" class="fnmarker" title="Men who are yearly selected by the inhabitants..." id="fnm1" name="fnm1">1</a> and a deacon in
		the church, was delegated by his colleagues to bring to the alms-house
		the &#8216;lone woman&#8217; who forms the chief subject of our homely story.
		The widow Selden (a brief history of whom it will be necessary to
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>214</span>give) had received an education suited rather to the respectability and
		former wealth of her family, than to its subsequent reduced condition,
		became in early life the wife of a merchant of our village, a man of
		good character and fair prospects, to whom she was much attached.
		Traders in New-England where wealth is so eagerly sought, are, especially
		in country towns, men of much consideration, as engaged in a
		money-making business. Mrs. Selden, therefore, independently of her
		personal merits, was not likely to be neglected. Her company was
		sought by the best society of our place, and she exchanged visits on
		equal terms even with the families of the clergyman and the village
		lawyer.</p>


		<p>A few years of quiet enjoyment passed, happily varied by the accession
		of a fair and delicate little girl, who might be seen at their cheerful
		meals seated in her high chair, the common object of their care and
		attention; and not only affording in her fragile little person the strongest
		bond of union, but the never-tiring subject of conversation. Sad indeed
		was the change in this once happy family, when the widow and orphan
		sat alone at the cheerless board. Death had entered and taken from
		them the sun of their little world. The bereaved wife might have sunk
		under this calamity, had not maternal solicitude been mixed with grief.
		With that admirable fortitude and submission to duty so common to
		those of her sex in similar circumstances, she at once devoted herself
		with increased solicitude to the remaining object of her care and
		affection.</p>

		<p>For a time but little change was visible in the family arrangements,
		for though a sensitive she was a spirited woman. Her garden, which
		had been the pride and delight of her husband, still flourished in perfect
		neatness. After the usual time of decent seclusion, she again interchanged
		visits with her friends and neighbors, and continued to maintain
		the stand in the village society which had always been conceded to her.
		But this state of things did not long continue, for alas! the <em>gathering</em> as
		well as the <em>protecting</em> hand was removed. Her more aristocratic acquaintances
		now began to remark that her table showed less of plenty
		and variety than formerly, and that her dress, though perfectly neat,
		was less new and fashionable than they expected in <em>their</em> associates;
		for no where is the distinction between the rich and poor more rigidly
		enforced than in country villages. Most offensively marked is this distinction
		in the house of God, where if any where this side the grave
		ought the rich and the poor to meet on a level, before Him who regards
		not the outward estate of his creatures. But modern Christians have
		contrived to evade the rebuke of the apostle by the cunning device of
		introducing the noisy auctioneer, and under a show of fairness and
		equality, &#8216;the man in goodly apparel and having a gold ring&#8217; is assigned
		the highest seat; and albeit a skeptic, by the weight of his purse crowds
		the humble worshippers to the wall and into the corners of their Father&#8217;s
		house.</p>

		<p>It was observed that the lone woman declined competition for those
		seats so eagerly sought by the more wealthy, and selected those of a
		humbler character, and eventually retired to the &#8216;widow&#8217;s pew,&#8217; a pew
		set apart, in country churches, for the gratuitous accommodation of
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>215</span>those in that unhappy condition. Sincerely religious, the Christian
		widow still waited upon God in the house of prayer, but felt the whole
		sting of poverty when slowly and humbly wending her way to her obscure
		corner, her faded and well-worn dress was brushed by the new
		and rich garments of her former equals as they swept past her to their
		high seats. The neat and handsome dwelling with its trim garden was
		at length resigned for one which barely sheltered the mother and child
		from the weather, and was totally devoid of the cheap luxury of fruit
		and flowers which had enriched and beautified their former home.</p>

		<p>Time wore on, and Want with its train of sordid attendants visited
		their dwelling. Her former associates, one after another declined her
		society as an equal. Occasionally calling, they were eloquent in
		excuses for their neglect; for when did the prosperous lack an excuse
		for neglecting the unfortunate? Counsel and advice were lavished upon
		her; for I have observed that advice is the only thing that the rich impart
		freely to the poor. Religion too was the frequent subject of their
		conversation; for how can benevolence be shown more strongly than by
		a concern for the well-being of the soul, which is to exist forever, in
		comparison with which, the transient wants of the body are as nothing?
		Accordingly, the poor widow, after her scanty meal, and over her dim
		and cheerless hearth, was exhorted by her fur-clad and well-fed <em>friends</em>,
		to disregard the evils of this fleeting life, and receive with resignation the
		chastenings of Providence; for we all needed correction, being by nature
		utterly sinful and depraved. And after some vague and indefinite offers
		of assistance, the good women would take their leave. A way of discharging
		duty discovered by modern philanthropists; and when accompanied
		by the Societies&#8217; tract, seldom fails to convince the unfortunate
		object of charity that to Heaven alone should they look for assistance and
		sympathy.</p>

		<p>This lady, as we have intimated, possessed a large share of that generous
		spirit so common in her sex, which enabled her to sustain herself
		amid the evils which oppressed her. And nobly did the mother strive
		to shield from want and ignorance the little orphan, now her only care.
		Her own education enabled her in some measure to supply the place of
		teachers, which she was unable to employ. And never was maternal
		care better rewarded than by the improvement of the gentle being under
		her charge. But in this blessed employment the poor mother was interrupted.
		While health continued, she had been enabled by the most
		unremitted exertion to prevent the approach of absolute want, slight
		indeed as were her earnings. (The modern improvements in machinery
		having destroyed domestic manufacture, properly so called, and left but
		little for the female to earn who is not attending its motions in the noisy
		factory.) But illness had intervened, and diminished even that small
		resource; and it was apparent to all that the want of suitable food assisted
		in blanching still more the fair face of the poor child. Maternal
		love had conquered the honest pride of the poor mother so far as to constrain
		her to accept the slight and uncertain donations of her neighbors.
		But this assistance, scanty as it was, could not continue. The tax-paying
		husbands of the benevolent ladies who furnished it, complained that
		the poor-rates were heavy, and that they had already helped to pay for a
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>216</span>house of refuge for the poor and the destitute, could not, in addition to
		this, support them out of it.</p>

		<p>She was told it was her duty to place her daughter in some family to be
		brought up as a servant. In vain did she assert her ability to maintain
		herself and child when health should return. Her advisers could little
		sympathize with her feelings, and reproached her with pride. And she
		was now harassed with the fear that her delicate and cultivated little
		girl would be torn from her, and made a factory slave or household
		drudge; for such power had the laws given to the rulers of the town.
		But this fear, miserable as it was, was now overpowered by another.
		The suggestion had reached the ear of the unhappy woman that she and
		her child would be conveyed to the house of the town&#8217;s poor, the place
		we have attempted to describe. God grant that no fair reader of this
		homely but too true story should ever feel the misery which this fear
		inflicted on the mind of this friendless mother! Oh, that true Charity
		had been present in the person of her best representative on earth, a sensible,
		affectionate and liberal-minded woman, to minister to the wants,
		to soothe the mind of her unhappy sister-woman, and cheer her exertions
		for self-support! None such appeared, and the heart of the poor woman
		sank within her. Her exertions were paralyzed; for struggle as she
		might to avoid it, the alms-house, with its debased and debasing society,
		was ever before her eyes as her ultimate destiny. It was in vain that
		she endeavored to prepare her mind for this result. She could endure
		any degree of privation, but not degradation and infamy.</p>

		<p>Time wore on, without any renewed hints of interference, and she
		began to hope that she was forgotten. Delusive hope! It was felt as
		a disgrace that she should suffer, when the <em>law</em> had provided a remedy,
		and they had paid for it. And it was therefore decreed by the magnates
		of the town that she must be removed, and the day had arrived
		(with which we commenced our narrative,) on which the paupers were
		to be disposed of for the coming year. <span class="keep_together">Deacon S&#8212;&#8212;</span> was the person
		deputed by his colleagues, as we have mentioned, to convey Mrs. Selden
		and her daughter to the alms-house.</p>

		<p>However prepared we may suppose ourselves to meet misfortune, the
		moment of its arrival takes us by surprise. We will not attempt to picture
		the utter desolation of mind and the despair which filled her heart,
		when this man arrived at her door, to convey herself, and oh! far worse,
		her innocent and intelligent child, to that scene of vice and debasement.
		Although her dislike to the measure was known, yet from her quiet
		and reserved manners, little opposition was anticipated. The evils of
		life had accumulated upon her in a regular gradation, and she had
		been enabled to bear their weight, up to this point, with outward composure;
		looking forward to, but yet hoping this last cup of bitterness would
		never be presented; or if presented, that some means might be found to
		avert it. But the dreadful crisis had arrived. Had the whole board of
		authority been present, I should be glad to believe, for the honor of humanity,
		that they would have been moved to relent, as they would not
		have been able to shift the responsibility from one to the other, as is the
		wont of such bodies when the members act separately.</p>

		<p>When the poor woman had so far recovered from the first shock as to
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>217</span>be enabled to articulate, she pleaded her ability to maintain herself without
		assistance, and her choice rather to starve than be removed. She
		appealed to him as the father of a daughter, and painted the ruin which
		would fall upon her own, exposed to the corruption and example of the
		place to which he was taking her. She appealed to him as a Christian,
		and reminded him that they had sat together before the sacred desk, and
		partaken of the symbols of the body and blood of the Son of Him who was
		in a peculiar manner the father of the widow and orphan. But her auditor
		was destitute of the imagination which enables the possessor to enter into
		the feelings of another; and these affecting appeals fell dead upon his
		worldly and unsympathizing nature. The man even extended his hand to
		urge her forward to the conveyance provided! At that moment, when all
		hope was dead within her, and the worst that could happen in her opinion
		had arrived, a change came over the unhappy woman. She suffered
		herself unresistingly to be led forward to her doom. The fine
		chords of the mind and heart, lately so intensely strung, had parted; her
		countenance relaxed, and her features settled down into a dead, unmeaning
		apathy; never again, during the short remainder of her life, to be
		animated by one gleam of the feelings which had so lately illumined but
		to destroy.</p>

		<p>My kind, my indulgent mother! Her generous heart needed not the
		eloquence of my youthful feelings to induce her to rescue the poor
		orphan, and to cherish her as her own child. And never was kindness
		more <span class="keep_together">richly&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>

		<p>I had proceeded thus far in writing this narrative, when I discovered
		that I was overlooked; and a gentle voice over my shoulder said: &#8216;You
		should not praise your own wife; it is the same as if you should praise
		yourself!&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">I have</span> this evening, while seated in my lonely chamber, ventured&#8212;not,
		I hope, with profane hands&#8212;to draw one inappreciable gem from
		out of the carcanet of each of the two unrivalled masters of the poetry
		of our language. I was curious to see the effect to be produced by a
		close juxtaposition of these two exquisite specimens of the soul&#8217;s light;
		of the revealment of its original genius; of the intense brilliancy of its
		Truth, falling as it does in one ray upon two objects so diverse in their
		character as the virgin love of the retired and comparatively humble but
		devoted Helena, and the married constancy of the Father of our race.</p>

		<p>The effect reminds me of an <i>échappée de lumière</i> that I once beheld
		in the gallery of the Vatican, when a sudden emergence of light brightened
		with the same gleam the calm face of the Virgin of the clouds,
		(called di Foligno,) and at the same instant illuminated the whole principal
		figure in the Transfiguration of Raffaelle; floating as it does, and
		tending almost with a movement upward, in the air of &#8216;the high mountain&#8217;
		where the miracle took <span class="keep_together">place&#8212;&#8212;</span>as these two grand paintings then
		stood, side by side, in the solemn, in the holy quiet of that lofty and
		sequestered apartment. O moment! never to be forgotten, never to be
		obscured by any lapse of after time!</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219"></a>219</span>And thus, although in a less palpable world, do these two passages of
		immortal verse, wearing each its beam of golden light, stand in their
		effulgence before the sympathies of the observer alive to the charms and
		influences of moral beauty! Surely no other poet has the world produced
		comparable to Shakspeare for the revelation of the love of the yet
		unwedded girl; and who is there to be named with Milton, in the tenderness
		and truth with which he has touched upon conjugal relationship;
		and that necessity, that inappeasable requirement of intercommunion that
		accompanies, as its immediate consequence, the sacrament of the nuptial
		rite where there is destined to exist the real, the progressive, the
		indissoluble intermarriage of soul with soul!</p>

		<p>How effectually and with what truth does the dramatic Bard raise
		the veil and exhibit to us the imagination of this retired girl, bred up in
		all the deep earnestness of mind that a country life and comparative
		seclusion could induce, dwelling and brooding over the form of one individual
		brought into intimate association with her, &#8216;seeing him every
		hour&#8217; where she had little else to interest her, nor any thing to contemplate,
		but, as she says,</p>

		<p>I still pour in the waters of my love</p>
		<p>And lack not to love still.&#8217;</p>
		</div>
		</div>

		<p>Behold her as she sits, the beautiful creation!&#8212;delighting to magnify
		the qualities of the idol of her affections and to depreciate herself in the
		comparison; overlooking, perhaps incapable of once imagining the
		thought of his harsh and selfish and impracticable nature, and constantly
		endowing him with all the fresher breathings of her spiritual existence&#8212;like
		the Rainbow of the Waterfall, that clothes, with its own
		celestial dyes, the dark and shapeless mass of Rock upon whose bosom it
		appears to dwell! faltering, trembling, quivering, fading, disappearing;
		returning, resting;&#8212;glowing, yet never dazzling; liquid, yet sustained!</p>

		<p>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</p>
		<p>The hind that would be mated by the lion</p>
		<p>Must die for love!</p>
		</div>
		</div>

		<p>This is the way in which these precious irradiations of joy beam and
		hover over man; startled and frightened often out of the presence even
		of his image while they thus adorn and decorate him; and then they
		love him for what they fondly dream to be the halo of his proper spirit;
		for the light and tenderness, the purity, the gentleness, the refinement
		and grace, that have their life and element and colour, only in the deep
		yet overflowing heart of Woman in her Love!</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>220</span>But then comes Wedlock; and often, with wedlock, comes marriage;
		or succeeds it; the marriage that <span class="special_name">God</span> bestowed on man in Eve, when,
		according to that scriptural and exquisite conception, <em>they twain become
		one</em>. When the Rock shall as by a miracle receive into all its crevices,
		interstices, and pores, the beautiful existence that has played upon it!
		When the soul of man opens at every noble passion in succession and at
		every pulse, to embrace, imbibe, absorb, receive, possess, acquire, the
		being that we call <span class="special_name">Woman</span>! finds her in every former want, or present
		wish, or bright, or unfrequented passage of the soul; now all occupied,
		all satisfied by her; fancies thoughts to be his thoughts which are her
		thoughts; and blesses himself, when he discovers it, that imaginations
		in themselves so sweet, should in some visit of her delicate spirit have
		been breathed into his <span class="special_name">Essence</span> from a source so pure! is near her, when
		distant; is present with her, when absent; converses with her, without
		words; gazes upon her, without sight; listens to her, without sound;
		watches her, without motion; and has not yet lost her balmy presence
		when Death shall long have removed forever that precious image from
		his corporal sense. This is <span class="special_name">Marriage</span>.</p>

		<p>Out of this state descends that profound expression of the soul in
		Milton, (<span class="special_name">God</span> make us thankful for him!) when he intends the verb that
		he escapes in the passage that adorns my Essay, should be supplied by a
		pulsation in the breast of Eve:</p>


		<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i14">&#8216;yet loss of thee</p>
		<p>Would never&#8212;from my heart.&#8217;</p>
		</div>
		</div>

		<p>Would never?&#8212;would never be torn, out-rooted, obliterated, banished,
		extinguished, forgotten, diminished, obscured, from his heart. The
		throb of her spirit is to supply the word, or mould the thought, and vivify
		the pause so as to satisfy her full affection to its utmost contentment
		and desire. <em>This</em> is marriage. This is attainment to that state of more
		perfect existence which terrestrial life procures for the soul of man, never
		thenceforth in all its future changes to be lost. The incorporeal mingling,
		the mystical union of two varied emanations of life; as Light and
		Heat intermarry in their offset and passage from the sun; and Truth
		and Love from the breast of <span class="special_name">The Ineffable</span>!</p>

		<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>How can I live without thee! how forego</p>
		<p>Thy sweet converse and love so dearly join&#8217;d</p>
		<p>To live again in these wild woods forlorn?</p>
		<p>Should <span class="special_name">God</span> create another Eve and I</p>
		<p>Another rib afford, yet loss of thee</p>
		<p>Would never from my heart: no, no, I feel</p>
		<p>The link of nature draw me.</p>
		<p>Bone of my bone thou art and from thy state</p>
		<p>Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.</p>
		</div>
		</div>

		<p>And shall the passage of one such soul across the mere brook of Death
		dissolve affiances so deep, so latent, and so pure as this? This Life of
		Life, is it to be so suddenly quenched in man, and man himself continue
		to exist? Shall the soul that lingers here still retaining its identity lose
		that which has chiefly formed for it a distinctive being? Or entering
		into a happier state of existence shall it be dispossessed of all that treasure
		of recollection and delight on which its joys and hopes have been
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>221</span>so largely founded? These long remembrances of mutual beneficence
		and good, these intertwining and interwoven affections, and the unbounded
		and mingling love of their common offspring, shall these all perish
		and the soul itself yet be styled immortal? Or,&#8212;shall the first-gone
		spirit meet its arriving mate upon the border of that further shore, bless
		it with the radiant welcome of celestial companionship and guidance,
		and lead it on to higher virtue in a happier state, as it hath beamed upon

		<h2 class="title">THE TYRANNY OF AFFECTION.</h2>

		<h3 class="byline">BY MRS. ENNSLO.</h3>

		<p><span class="first_word">Methinks</span> those who preach up the dignity of human nature, and
		expatiate upon its original perfections, must look upon it through magic
		glasses: to some perceptions at least, it presents even in its best estate a
		picture of such abortive aims, such woful short-comings, such clouded
		brightness, that even in those better natures, where we feel sure that the
		sun of virtue <em>does</em> shine, the noxious vapors of human frailty, pride in
		all its various ramifications, selfishness under its many disguises, prejudice
		with its endless excuses, etc., etc., do so envelope it that we cannot
		hope to feel the warmth of its rays until some wholesome trial, some
		aptly-apportioned cross, clear away these paralyzing influences and force
		it into action.</p>

		<p>What seems at the first glance freer from this dross than the love of
		man to man? the love of the creature for his fellow; the ordained test
		of his love to his Creator? What seems more preëminently pure than
		the affection of the parent for the child, who owes him not only life but
		the nurture which has maintained and elevated that life? Yet even
		here, even over this fair garden of peace, the trail of the serpent may be
		detected. The tyranny of deep affection is seen in every relation of
		life: we love a cherished object, it may be with every fibre of our heart,
		ay, even idolatrously; we would willingly spend and be spent to surround
		the beloved one with materials for enjoyment; but these materials
		must be of <em>our</em> selection; we would sacrifice ourselves to lead them
		to happiness, but <em>we</em> must point out the road to them; we will bear every
		thing, endure every thing, but the mortification of seeing them receive
		good at other hands than our own. Ah! there are some rare exceptions
		to this rule, but surely not more than enough to constitute it a rule.</p>

		<p>Who that enjoyed the privilege of domestic intercourse with the venerable
		and venerated father of the lovely Lucy Lee; he the most beloved
		as well as respected inhabitant of the small town of <span class="keep_together">&#8212;&#8212;;</span> she not
		only the prettiest but by far the most winning in her deportment of all
		the young female circle of the place, of whom she was beyond all question
		the ornament. Who that witnessed the fond pride with which the
		good old man gazed upon her, as she glided around him, ministering to
		his wants with that watchful ingenuity which characterizes woman&#8217;s
		affection; who that heard the tone of tenderness which marked even
		the most trifling word addressed to her; a tenderness that seemed as if it
		might by its deep pathos invoke every beneficent spirit to watch over her
		for good; his early morning greeting, always accompanied by an upward
		look, which proclaimed a daily aspiration of gratitude to the great
		Giver for the precious gift; the nightly benediction which ever seemed
		as if it might grow into a prayer for her welfare during the hours of
		darkness; who that witnessed all this&#8212;and they could not be seen together
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>223</span>without many such hourly demonstrations of the father&#8217;s love for
		his child shining through his every word and action&#8212;but would have
		felt assured that this love fashioned his every plan, and marked his estimate
		of the things of life?</p>

		<p>Ah! of a certainty, it must have been so; her happiness must have
		been safe in his keeping; and in truth, happiness had hitherto seemed
		hers by prescriptive right. But all lanes however long turn at last,
		and those most richly strewn with flowers are generally alas! by far
		the shortest. Eighteen summers had flown since that which saw the
		little Lucy installed sole possessor and sole solace of her bereaved father&#8217;s
		heart; sole pledge of a love which deeply rooted in a breast no longer subject
		to the changeful fancies of youth, (for he had more than attained the
		prime of middle-age when the original of the precious little miniature
		first enchained his affections,) never revived for any other, but spent
		itself in a doting fondness for this fair image of the lost one. Indeed it
		seemed that every throb came with a double import from his burdened
		heart; the parent&#8217;s fondness ever mingling a tribute to the memory of
		her whose life had been the price of the costly gift.</p>

		<p>It is not always that the devotion of a parent is so entirely appreciated
		as in this case; all Mr. Lee&#8217;s efforts to promote his daughter&#8217;s happiness
		were crowned with entire success, and until the period mentioned
		above, no one had ever detected on her lovely brow the semblance of a
		cloud. But the course of nature cannot be altered; the petted child will
		one day grow into the wilful woman; and however it may have been
		only a pleasant task to follow the windings of the childish fancy ingenious
		in its caprice; and only amusing to submit to the childish tyranny
		which pursues its own beau-ideal of sport with reckless pertinacity;
		there sometimes comes a change when the spoiled darling takes her first
		step upon the threshold of maturity; when, with all the fresh vigor of
		youth in her untutored will, she begins to assert her privilege, to cater
		for her own happiness, and fashion her future according to the visions of
		her own fancy. Then comes in the world with its many and diversified
		claims; claims so vigorously enforced, but from which it is the first impulse
		of the young heart to turn with loathing: it cannot bear to believe
		its happy independence of all such considerations at an end; it does not
		submit easily to these new trammels. Ah! how differently has passed
		the previous life! Something holy gathers round a child; it seems to
		move superior to the base claims of the world and its paltry rewards;
		and although often, it must be confessed, the young intellect is early impressed
		with the idea that its best efforts should be devoted to the insuring
		of worldly approbation, still the little one&#8217;s course of life is so distinct
		from the busy race to which we would train it, that we cannot if
		we would entirely chain down its thoughts; nay, we shrink before the
		pure innocence which cannot even understand our weakness; and often
		yield a tribute to its superior dignity by concealing our own care for such
		distinctions.</p>

		<p>To those too who have seen much of life, and learnt to feel its hollowness,
		real childishness of thought and feeling is so refreshing, that
		they love rather to prolong the period than to shorten it. To Mr. Lee
		the little Lucy seemed so entirely perfect in her infantine simplicity and
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>224</span>purity, that had he breathed a wish for the future, it would probably
		have been that she should always continue his <em>little</em> Lucy; he cared for
		no change, and as it appeared, perceived none in her. Time passed on
		however, and before he had become well aware that the little fairy whose
		tiny form must needs so short a while since clamber on his knee to
		stroke and pat his cheek, had now shot up into a tall girl, who could take
		his arm in a long walk, or canter beside him all the morning on her well
		trained pony, there came a change over the course of his quiet household
		little startling. Visitors began to throng the hall; not those staid
		personages who had hitherto been wont to gather round the warm hearth
		in winter, or the sheltered piazza in the hot days of summer, and with
		feet upreared on mantel-piece or bannister, discuss the affairs of state,
		and the price of crops; new editions of these respected individuals now
		appeared; nephews and sons came in their train; young friends, more
		perhaps than these gentlemen were before aware of possessing, sought
		an introduction at their hands, or came without any, on the plea perhaps
		of having met at a tea-party, or some such strong necessity for acquaintanceship
		with the fair Lucy; while the good Mr. Lee, often to his not
		very pleased surprise, found on awaking from his afternoon&#8217;s nap, that
		the book whose contents he had purposed should perform their daily
		office of inspiring his dreams had been laid aside, while the voice
		which had lulled him to sleep was now charming other and younger
		ears in merry though perhaps suppressed cadences. The variety in
		these visitors too grew somewhat annoying; new people came, and Mr.
		Lee liked not new people. He was a man of warm but very exclusive
		feelings; he loved but a few, and he liked no others: his prejudices were
		strong, and having lived a very secluded life, the routine of which presented
		no very decided obstacle to those prejudices, his estimate of men and
		things had not altered with the general course of the world around him.
		Liberal to an extreme in his dealings with men, his intercourse with
		them, except in matters of business, was confined to a very limited circle.
		Absolute in his requisitions from such as approached him as intimates,
		his friendship was given only to those who met his views in every
		respect; especially whose political opinions coincided with his own.
		Indeed this seemed to be with him the one grand test. Though never
		meddling in his own person with public life, he had such an abstract love
		for its intricacies that he could at all times warm into actual enthusiasm
		over a newspaper; a single paragraph from the pen one of his own
		way of thinking sufficing to kindle his feelings into a glow of patriotism,
		while a civil word of dissent would seem to chill his sympathies for his
		kind; strong disapprobation blinding his perceptions to any good possible
		in those differing from his established standard. Now it was not to
		be expected that the young Lucy&#8217;s circle would be modelled according
		to such restrictions; she loved her kind old father with the clinging
		fondness of an unweaned infant for its mother; but though again and
		again she would, to gratify him, toil through a whole pamphlet, its meaning
		as dark to her perceptions as the close and blurred print to his failing
		eyes, it may well be imagined that her girlish brain failed to receive
		any other impression from the contents than of their excessive tedium;
		certainly if she formed therefrom any opinion regarding his favorite
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225"></a>225</span>party, it was most probably the not very flattering one that its members
		were all especially tiresome and prolix.</p>

		<p>Either from this notion, or a contradiction natural to human nature, it
		so happened that among the rivals for the lovely Lucy&#8217;s smiles, none
		seemed to possess such power in riveting her attention as a certain young
		gentleman, who although not only the son of a leading man in the opposition,
		but holding himself a somewhat prominent place in the ranks of
		the condemned party, yet continued with a boldness much to be wondered
		at to engross the young lady&#8217;s time by frequent visits of most
		unfashionable length, in spite of Mr. Lee&#8217;s open vituperations of all the
		manœuvres of the said party. The undaunted aspirant turned a deaf
		ear however to this, taking every thing that was said in good part, until
		one day, when suddenly his patience seemed to give out.</p>

		<p>News had just been received of the marriage of a former school-mate
		of Lucy&#8217;s, the daughter of an old esteemed comrade, orthodox in all his
		views, to an individual decidedly in the wrong on the one important
		point. First, how astonished, next how entirely shocked, was the good
		old gentleman! &#8216;What a falling off! to give his child to <span class="keep_together">&#8212;&#8212;!</span> Pshaw!
		what would the world come to! Where were his principles? where his
		wisdom? where his <em>honor</em>?&#8217; etc., etc. Lucy, frightened perhaps at her
		father&#8217;s vehemence, turned pale. Dr. Kent, the friend and physician
		of the family, who chanced to be present, endeavored to calm him, but
		with little success; and Mr. Lillburgh, unable as it seemed to join in
		condemning this &#8216;mis-alliance,&#8217; left the house somewhat abruptly. Soon
		after this, however, an opportune influx of papers and pamphlets caused
		a salutary diversion in Mr. Lee&#8217;s irritated feelings; and as Lucy&#8217;s most
		monopolizing visitor seemed quite to have disappeared, he could now
		enjoy his favorite luxury of drinking in, through the medium of the voice
		he loved so well, the words of wisdom he honored so highly.</p>

		<p>Whether these tiresome lectures proved too burdensome for her young
		spirits, or some other cause operated to injure her health, did not appear;
		but just at this time, when Mr. Lee seemed to find his life especially
		comfortable and pleasant, his hitherto blooming daughter gradually began
		to droop; her spirits, formerly so even, were now constantly fluctuating:
		at times she would sit pale and <i>distraite</i> among a gay and laughing
		circle of her young associates, while at others, a ring at the bell, a
		step in the hall, would suffice to call the color to her cheek and kindle
		animation in her eye. It was this variation perhaps, together with certain
		animating plans of his own, which rendered her father insensible to
		her condition; for by a strange contradiction in the course of things, he
		seemed just at this time especially occupied with forming brilliant plans
		for her future. Fairly aware now of her being no longer a child, he
		would comment upon her dress, urge her to more ornament, and then
		with a knowing look speak of his anticipated pleasure in the society of
		two expected visitors, one staunch old veteran of the true faith, and his
		son, a worthy descendant, one who deserved the smiles of the fair for the
		brilliant speech he had made the last session. Poor Lucy at each reference
		to this subject would look more and more uncomfortable; but her
		father, thinking that she might be perhaps a little wayward; while he
		grew daily more enamoured of his plan, redoubled his tenderness, seeking
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page226" name="page226"></a>226</span>to study her whims in every other respect. It is cruel to loose every
		bond but that which galls most sorely, to pluck away every thorn but
		that which pricks most sharply: all the perceptions gather to that point,
		and the suffering is in consequence tenfold more acute. Such were
		Lucy&#8217;s sensations, though she was perhaps scarcely conscious of them
		herself; while at every demonstration of her father&#8217;s tenderness, the
		feelings which she knew to be rebels to his dearest wishes would seem
		to spring up and accuse her of ingratitude. This struggle could not
		last; at length the fond father became suddenly aware that some strange
		blight had fallen upon his darling, and his whole soul was convulsed at
		the thought that evil might possibly threaten her; he felt ready to send a
		proclamation through the world to summon all its skill to spend itself for
		her restoration. Upon second thoughts he made up his mind that there
		was but one man in the world to whom he would confide the precious
		trust; yes, he was fully assured that in the brain of Dr. Kent, the only
		lineal descendant of Esculapius, were to be found all the best resources
		of the art of healing; <em>he</em> must always and on all occasions, be more
		right than any one else. Why? But why ask why, when he had formed
		this opinion ever since Dr. Kent first assumed the <span class="keep_together">M. D.</span>, and had
		always held it firmly. Dr. Kent was summoned and soon appeared;
		the startled girl, sorely against her will, was called into the room; all the
		usual ceremony gone through; the pulse tested, the tongue examined,
		etc., and then suffered to slip out of the room. Mr. Lee listened with a
		beating heart for the doctor&#8217;s decision: this last did not deny that the
		young lady&#8217;s appearance was strangely altered since he had last seen
		her, which indeed was not since the evening above alluded to, of Mr.
		Lee&#8217;s violent irritation against his old friend. But the cause; the next
		thing for the doctor to do was to discover the cause. Now Dr. Kent,
		although some people did say that he was no student, had a considerable
		portion of what is called <em>mother-wit</em>; and if he did not possess the stores of
		learning which might have been amassed by poring over his books, he was
		at least without the abstraction which much scientific research is thought
		to occasion; he looked around him with a shrewd eye, and simply by putting
		two and two together, often made very successful calculations. He
		hesitated, reflected and recollected; &#8216;perhaps she wanted excitement,&#8217;
		he said; &#8216;perhaps there was too little variety in her life for one so young.&#8217;
		Mr. Lee assured him that she had always appeared very indifferent to
		society; that until very lately she had always seemed as happy as the
		day was long, and to desire no other company than that of the visitors
		who dropped in upon them occasionally.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Well, we must have something more amusing for her than <em>visiting</em>;
		something more exciting.&#8217; The doctor here mused again for a few moments:
		&#8216;You say she has seemed happy until very lately?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Yes, it is only lately that she has seemed to droop.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Well, perhaps she&#8217;s been particularly dull lately; now by way of
		experiment, suppose you at once summon a large party to your house;
		let it be a very general invitation; all your acquaintances, that is the
		young ones, <em>her</em> acquaintances; all who have ever visited at the house;
		and as <em>you</em> may not be able to remember them all, it will be best to
		direct her to do it in your name; this will of itself furnish her with
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227"></a>227</span>a rather exciting occupation. All this is by way of experiment I say,
		for it may <em>not</em> be that she needs amusement, but by the effect that company
		and gayety have upon her, which I shall take care to be by and
		watch. I have a notion that I shall be enabled to decide upon the character
		of her indisposition. One thing however; remember you must
		give me <i>carte-blanche</i> as to the course of treatment to be pursued; your
		prejudices, you confess you have them, must not hamper me.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;My prejudices!&#8217; replied Mr. Lee; &#8216;why what can they have to do
		with your prescriptions? You know me well enough to be aware that
		I do not undertake to meddle with matters I do not understand; the art
		of medicine for instance, to which I make no pretensions; of course I
		shall not interfere; only tell me what is to be done for my child, and
		you may be very sure no difficulty will arise on my part, should it be
		that I must take her to Egypt or Kamtschatka.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;It is not probable that I shall call upon you for any such effort; on
		the contrary, I have a strong impression that a very simple course will
		answer; I was afraid you might not like its simplicity.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Really,&#8217; said Mr. Lee, &#8216;that is too bad; am I that sort of person?
		Don&#8217;t tantalize me, Doctor, but just tell me what ought to be done for my
		poor child, and you must be assured that <em>I</em> will not object.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Of course, no father would,&#8217; said Dr. Kent.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Then why the deuce do you imagine for an instant that <em>I</em> would?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Nay now,&#8217; said the physician, &#8216;it is only a whim of mine, and every
		one must be allowed some whims: but good day; remember your
		promise.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Oh yes, only make up your mind at once.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Great was Lucy&#8217;s surprise, when upon being again summoned by
		her father, she received from him the commission just determined upon.
		At one moment to have her pulse felt, and the next to be told that she
		must prepare for entertaining a large party! What did it mean? The
		good father, startled at her agitation, assured her that he himself felt the
		want of a little more society, and that he thought it would do <em>him</em> good
		to have a company of gay young people about him for an evening.
		Lucy was afraid she could not recollect all her acquaintances. &#8216;Well,
		no matter; only invite all she <em>could</em> remember; he should be satisfied
		with her arrangement of the affair.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Whatever may have been the efforts of Lucy&#8217;s memory, it is certain
		that only a moderate number of tickets were sent out for the appointed
		evening; indeed it might have been feared that the doctor&#8217;s experiment
		could scarcely have a fair scope in so limited a circle; but finding that
		his patient had had her own way in the whole, <em>he</em> seemed to feel quite
		assured of success. Before etiquette would have permitted the arrival
		of any other guest, he had taken his place close beside the fair mistress
		of the revels, and even after the room began to fill, seemed determined
		to yield his envied position to no one. Those who said Dr. Kent was
		no student, should have seen him then; his eye riveted on her fair
		young countenance, there could be no doubt he was conning <em>that</em> closely.
		At every fresh arrival, how he watched the eager glance of inquiry!
		how his gaze followed the course of the eloquent blood as it left the
		transparent cheek, again to burden the disappointed heart!</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>228</span>The doctor was still puzzled; the gay company had by no means yet
		wrought the change he looked for; how was this?&#8212;but he held to his
		watch. And now once more the door was thrown open, and a young
		gentleman, with a decidedly hesitating air and step, approached the
		youthful hostess. Ah! now the light no longer flickered in her clear
		blue eye; it literally danced: the awakened color left her cheek it is
		true, as before, but how soon it came again! &#8216;You positively have
		stood long enough, and must sit down now,&#8217; said Dr. Kent, taking Lucy&#8217;s
		hand; not the tip-ends of her fingers; no, the doctor was not one either
		to be satisfied with any such superficial plan of action, or to forego his
		privileges; on the contrary, availing himself of his position of friend
		of the family, he possessed himself of the whole of the little delicate
		hand, when, old habit it might be, leading him to measure with some
		exactness the slender wrist thereto belonging, he pressed it most cordially,
		and after one or two moments of such demonstration of his affectionate
		regard, yielded his place beside her to the last comer.</p>

		<p>Mr. Lee now joined him as he lounged upon a sofa, with an air of
		entire inattention to what was going on around him, yet turning from
		time to time a heedful glance upon Lucy who sat just opposite, replying
		more by blushes than words to the depressed tones of young Mr. Lillburgh&#8217;s
		voice. &#8216;Well, Doctor, and how goes on the experiment?&#8217; The
		anxious father tried to speak calmly, but his voice trembled.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I am quite satisfied with my <em>experiment</em>,&#8217; replied Dr. Kent; &#8216;but I
		will confess (you know I am a candid man) that the result makes me
		feel a little serious.&#8217; Dr. Kent knew, as we all have an opportunity of
		knowing, that a danger, however startling, for which we are at once provided
		with a remedy, is soon scorned; that it must stare us very decidedly
		in the face, before we are willing to appreciate the said remedy.
		&#8216;Yes,&#8217; continued he. &#8216;I had no idea of the deep root the disease had
		taken.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Good heavens! my friend,&#8217; exclaimed Mr. Lee, grasping Dr. Kent&#8217;s
		hand in the utmost agitation; &#8216;and the remedy you thought of&#8212;is the
		case too serious for it to be available?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I trust not,&#8217; replied the Doctor; &#8216;I believe indeed that if I can apply
		the proper remedy in time, all may be well; but as I said just now, I
		am a candid man, and don&#8217;t like to raise false hopes: I tell you frankly
		this case is not one to be trifled with; it requires nice management:
		the young lady is delicate, very delicate; her nervous system is now
		decidedly deranged.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;But don&#8217;t you think, Doctor, don&#8217;t you think, my good friend, that
		she looks a little better this evening? See how animatedly she is listening
		to that young man: by-the-by, who is he?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Oh, no matter who he is, so he amuses Miss Lucy. But with regard
		to her case; I will study it seriously to-night, and tell you what result
		I have come to to-morrow about noon. I shall give all my mind to it,
		for I know how precious she must be to you; I know that nothing the
		world has to give, can make up to you for the most trifling evil that can
		assail her.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Oh, nothing, nothing; but what tormenting apprehensions you fill
		me with! Gracious heaven! my dear Sir, she is my all; my past, my
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>229</span>present, my future are made by her; but you will help me if you can.
		May Almighty wisdom aid you!&#8217; And the agitated father rushed out of
		the room, unable any longer to control himself.</p>

		<p>Dr. Kent looked after him with something of commiseration in his
		countenance; but being a decided enemy to homeopathic innovation, he
		had made up his mind that a strong dose of apprehension was positively
		necessary; and now, only gratified at its powerful effect, he resumed
		his surveillance with a heartlessly satisfied air. This was no doubt
		rendered the more easy to him by Mr. Lee&#8217;s continued absence from the
		room: the young Lucy, thus relieved from the observation which she
		unconsciously dreaded, growing more and more at her ease, enabled him
		to settle his opinion regarding her completely.</p>

		<p>The evening finished, as all evenings will; the night also took its
		course as usual; but when on the following morning Dr. Kent appeared
		according to promise in his friend&#8217;s parlor at the appointed hour, he saw
		at once that it had been passed by both in a manner very different from
		those lately preceding it. Lucy looked as if some new impetus had
		been given to her whole being; too much agitated for happiness, yet
		with animation glowing in every feature, while the poor old father&#8217;s
		care-burdened brow proclaimed that anxious apprehension had completely
		usurped the hours destined to repose. Dr. Kent really began to
		fear he had been too violent in his measures; at any rate, feeling sure,
		as he said to himself, that the instrument had been wound up to the
		striking point, he took his old friend by the arm, saying he wished to
		speak to him in the next room on business. Of course Mr. Lee was no
		sooner out of hearing of his daughter, than he began to question his
		visitor with the utmost eagerness; upon which the doctor slowly and
		warily proceeded to unfold his suspicions, or rather his convictions.</p>

		<p>It was curious to observe the changes passing over the countenance
		of the hearer as Dr. Kent made this disclosure. Pleased surprise was
		evidently the first emotion excited, but painful perplexity soon usurped
		its place.</p>

		<p>&#8216;My good friend,&#8217; said he, as Dr. Kent finished speaking, &#8216;I am
		greatly relieved to find that you think the cause of my child&#8217;s illness
		so superficial; but as to the remedy you propose, believe me, I cannot
		consent to it; I do not believe it necessary.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Believe it or not, as you will; I tell you it <em>is</em> necessary.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;But I tell you, Doctor, that my child is a part of myself, my own flesh
		and blood; and can you counsel me to become an apostate to my own
		principles? It has been my dearest thought that I should one day enjoy
		in my own seclusion the reflected lustre of my child&#8217;s brilliant position
		in the world, and that that position should be by the side of one whose
		course in life my own ripe judgment approves entirely. A man of Mr.
		Lillburgh&#8217;s principles cannot make her happy; I will not believe that
		he can. No, I have always cared for my daughter&#8217;s happiness; I will
		care for it still, by settling this matter for her as I best know how. No;
		again I say no; my only child shall not be so sacrificed!&#8217; And Mr. Lee
		stamped on the floor, as if to add force to his speech.</p>

		<p>&#8216;When you are cool,&#8217; said Dr. Kent, looking any thing but cool himself,
		&#8216;I will remind you of your promise, your positive promise; there
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230"></a>230</span>is Mr. Lillburgh now approaching the house; ask both your heart and
		conscience how he ought to be received. Good morning to you.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Without stopping to consult either of these counsellors, Mr. Lee
		hastily rang the bell. &#8216;We are both engaged, and cannot see the gentleman
		who is now coming to the door,&#8217; said he to the servant. The doorbell
		was heard at the instant, and the servant hastened to obey his master&#8217;s
		directions.</p>

		<p>The doctor was gone. Mr. Lee, pacing the parlor alone, imagined to
		himself all sorts of arguments to satisfy his conscience that he was in
		the right. Yet, thought he, my little darling must be made happy; all
		young girls love trinkets and finery; I will take her out with me this
		morning, and she shall indulge every caprice of her pretty fancy; pretty
		in every thing else but fixing itself on that Mr. Lillburgh. &#8216;Pshaw!
		he shall <em>not</em> have her; call Miss here,&#8217; he continued to a servant who
		entered at the moment. The servant returned after a few minutes,
		saying that he had knocked repeatedly at her door, but received no
		answer. Vaguely apprehensive of something wrong, Mr. Lee hastened
		himself to her chamber; but how was he shocked on entering, to find his
		daughter lying senseless in a swoon near an open window. Ah! what
		voice whispered him that she had seen and heard at that window what
		her delicate nerves could not endure! He raised her tenderly in his
		arms, and having with some difficulty restored her to consciousness,
		placed her on the bed. &#8216;Good heavens!&#8217; thought he, &#8216;can it be indeed
		so serious!&#8217; But he could not long speculate upon this subject; Lucy&#8217;s
		cheek, but just now so pale and marble-like, soon began to glow with
		fever; her pulse, but just restored to action, now told with momently increasing
		hurry that illness had seized the delicate frame; the sudden
		revulsion from new-born hope to despair had been too much for it.
		Poor Mr. Lee! what did his heart say now? Did it yet upbraid him?
		Dr. Kent, who had set out on a course of visits, could not at once be
		found, and the wretched father sat gazing in agonizing helplessness on
		his suffering child until the decline of the day. What would he have
		given to live over again the last few hours! At length the physician
		appeared: &#8216;Now,&#8217; said he, on accosting Mr. Lee, &#8216;do you think I know
		my own business or not? Do I make mountains of mole-hills or not?
		I knew what I was about, didn&#8217;t I?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Alas, yes!&#8217; replied the other, in a self-accusing tone, &#8216;and <em>I</em> did not;
		but oh! merciful Providence! is it too late now?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Too late? Heaven knows, poor young lady! she&#8217;d have been better
		off if she&#8217;d been an ugly twelfth daughter, with no one to trouble themselves
		much about her, instead of a beautiful darling, that must have
		one particular sort of happiness and no other.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Spare me! spare me, my friend!&#8217; implored Mr. Lee.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I wish you had spared yourself,&#8217; grumbled Dr. Kent.</p>

		<p>The Doctor was, it must be allowed, a little rough; but he had been
		so thoroughly annoyed, after having, as he thought, with unparalleled
		cunning and discretion detected the difficulty and provided a remedy,
		to find his plans thwarted by an obstinate wilfulness, that he could not
		help boiling over a little: his kind feelings however soon got the ascendency;
		the deep contrition of the poor father touched his heart, and the
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>231</span>lovely girl who had only increased his interest in her by making good
		his words, received from him the most attentive care; nor could he
		doubt that at length his advice was appreciated, when he heard Mr.
		Lee take every opportunity of mentioning Mr. Lillburgh&#8217;s name with
		approbation and kindness, always regretting that he had made such a
		mistake as to send him away the last time he had called at the house.</p>

		<p>But who may venture to choose their own time for showing kindness?
		Who may, having refused to &#8216;do good when it was in the power of his
		hand to do it,&#8217; resume at will the precious privilege? Dr. Kent, satisfied
		with his friend&#8217;s repentance, was willing to take any step which might
		avail to retrieve the mischief; but when this last would have lured back
		by civilities the repulsed lover, he was found to have left home the very
		day after his mortifying dismissal.</p>

		<p>Let those who only by looking <em>back</em> can see the road by which misery
		might have been escaped, while <em>before</em> the vista seems quite closed up,
		conceive the deep and agonizing perplexity of the anxious father. His
		daughter, comforted no doubt by his frequent recurrence to the subject
		near her heart, and the manner in which he treated it, slowly raised
		her drooping head; but he, (the entire amende being still out of his
		power) hung over her night and day, oppressed by a constant sensation
		of guilt, scarcely aware of her partial restoration. For some days this
		ordeal lasted; there seemed a risk that the lover might in the bitterness
		of his disappointment prolong his stay indefinitely; what availed it then
		that the prejudice and ambition which had exiled him were now annihilated?
		The eagerly coveted-prize for which he would have sacrificed
		his daughter&#8217;s peace, had turned to ashes in his grasp.</p>

		<p>But the door to returning happiness was not completely closed. Dr.
		Kent&#8217;s skill, aided no doubt by Lucy&#8217;s young confidence in her lover&#8217;s
		steadfastness, kept danger at bay, until one of those opportune accidents
		of life, which like many of the best things in it look threateningly until
		time takes off the veil, occurred in the shape of a fire on the premises
		of the wanderer; which news, forcing him to return, the indefatigable
		Dr. Kent at once offered to divert his mind from this untoward circumstance,
		by taking him to join the family dinner of his friend Mr. Lee.
		The sequel may be imagined; on the strength of this friendly invitation,
		aided no doubt by sundry blushes and smiles on Lucy&#8217;s part, Mr. Lillburgh
		ventured to resume his visits, and Lucy&#8217;s cheek always looked
		so particularly rosy on such occasions, that Mr. Lee soon became too
		entirely happy in the result, to cavil any longer at the cause of her renovated
		health and spirits. Sometimes, also, memory would recall for
		an instant that terrible period of anxiety, and then he would treat Mr.
		Lillburgh with such pointed cordiality, that before very long that young
		gentleman was emboldened to take advantage of his civility, and make
		some disclosure of his <em>own</em> plans for the fair Lucy&#8217;s happiness, according
		to the liberty of speech young gentlemen generally allow themselves
		when desirous of securing their own. Mr. Lee had gone too far
		to recede, and he soon found himself reduced to the necessity of resting
		all his hopes for the gratification of his favorite fancies and prejudices
		upon the anticipated course through life of another generation, whose
		future being happily so distant, promised him a long period of hope.</p>

		<h3 class="subtitle">A RHAPSODY.</h3>

		<div class="epigram">
		<p><span class="first_word">The</span> following effort of a wild and maddened imagination, rioting in its own unreal world, is by
		the &#8216;<span class="special_name">American Opium-Eater</span>,&#8217; whose remarkable history was given in the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span> for July,
		1842. The <span class="small_all_caps">MS.</span> is stained in several places with the powerful drug, to the abuse of which the writer
		was so irresistibly addicted. The subjoined remarks precede the poem: &#8216;This extravaganza is worthy
		of preservation only as &#8216;a psychological curiosity,&#8217; like <span class="special_name">Coleridge</span>&#8217;s &#8216;Kubla Khan,&#8217; which was
		composed under similar circumstances; if that indeed can be called composition, in which all the
		images rose up before the writer as <span class="small_all_caps">THINGS</span>, with a parallel production of the correspondent expressions,
		without any sensation or consciousness of effort. On awaking, he appeared to have a distinct
		recollection of the whole: taking his pen, ink and paper, he instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines
		that are here preserved. The state of corporeal sleep but intellectual activity, during the continuance
		of which the phenomenon above described occurred, was caused by a very large dose of opium,
		and came upon me while reading the &#8216;Confession of a Fratricide,&#8217; published by the priest who attended
		him in his last moments. I should warn the reader that the fratricide, like the author, could not be
		said to possess the &#8216;mens sana in corpore sano,&#8217; both having been deranged.&#8217;</p>

		<h2 class="title">SICILIAN SCENERY AND ANTIQUITIES.</h2>

		<h3 class="subtitle">NUMBER TWO.</h3>


		<p><span class="first_word">We</span> proceed, in another and concluding paper, as promised in the
		last number of the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>, to direct the reader&#8217;s attention to
		the <i>Architectural Antiquities of Sicily</i>, especially those of Grecian structure,
		which will be described in the order in which they were visited.
		The first are those of Egesta, or Segeste, as it is sometimes called;
		a city said to have been built in the remote age of the Siculi, and which
		was destroyed by Agathocles, the potter&#8217;s son, who reduced all Sicily
		two hundred and eighty years before the Christian era. It lies about
		forty or fifty miles from Palermo, among the mountains which cluster
		round the famed Mount Erix, on which once stood a temple dedicated to
		Venus. On leaving Alcamo, which may be called a city of convents,
		midway between Palermo and Segeste, the broad slopes of an ample
		valley lie before the traveller, which though almost treeless, are waving
		with beans, and grain and grass. In the depth, is a river meandering
		among fragrant oleanders; on the left, the valley is intersected by a
		range of distant mountains; on the right is a beautiful bay of the Mediterranean.
		Across the valley the mountains form a green amphitheatre,
		and high in its remotest part is seen the Temple of Segeste, but merely
		as a point of light and shade upon the bosom of the mountain. The
		next view, if he takes our route, is from the ancient Grecian city of
		Catafimi, itself perched on a mountain&#8217;s top. He looks down a deep
		luxuriant vale, and on a grassy knoll about three miles distant, lifted
		from the depths of the valley by precipitous crags, stands the solitary
		temple; and if seen as we saw it, receiving the last golden rays of the
		setting sun while all below is wrapped in shade. The next day, would
		he visit the temple, his road lies through the valley of which I have last
		spoken. And surely he never passed through such an Arcadian scene
		as this. Almond and orange trees fill the air with fragrance; his path
		struggles through the tangled flowers, the cistus and the blue convolvulus,
		and he disturbs the nightingale in her pleasant haunt. At length,
		emerging from the valley, and climbing the steep side of a mountain, he
		stands before the temple. It is a majestic pile, about two hundred feet
		in length and eighty-eight in breadth, having fourteen columns on each
		side and six at each end, in all thirty-six columns, of about six feet in
		diameter; not fluted, as is usual in Grecian Doric temples, but having
		a very peculiar form. It stands on a platform raised on three gigantic
		steps. All the columns are standing; the entablatures and pediments
		are in pretty good preservation, but it is roofless, and flowers and
		weeds are now waving where once trode the white-robed priests. The
		breezes from the fragrant mountains and the distant sea, of which it
		commands a fine view, sigh through it in harmony with its sad and solitary
		grandeur.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>237</span>On a neighboring hill are the vestiges of the ancient city, a few ruined
		towers, probably of the citadel, and a theatre, the stone seats of which
		are almost entire; part of the sculptured figure of a faun still remains
		on the proscenium; wild shrubs shade a great part of the ruin, and
		where manhood and beauty once sat, listening to the tragedies of an
		Eschylus or Euripides, the adder and the lizards sun themselves. The
		next ruins we visited were those of Selinunte, anciently Selinus or Selinuntium,
		which lies on the southern coast of the island. This city was
		founded by a colony of Greeks about twenty-five hundred years ago.
		It was taken during the Carthaginian wars, and in a great measure destroyed
		by Hannibal the son of Giscon, four hundred and nine years before
		<span class="special_name">Christ</span>. The country on approaching Selinunte is a dreary plain
		covered with the palmetto. On gazing toward the sea, when distant two
		or three miles, the traveller&#8217;s eye catches what he would take for a
		rocky hill, were it not for a few mutilated columns which rise above the
		blue horizon. As he approaches, the stupendous scene of ruin strikes
		him with awe. There in a mighty heap lie column and capital, metope
		and cornice; and the mind is lost in wonder at the power that raised
		these giant structures, and the power that overthrew them. Only one
		complete column, and that without its capital, and several mutilated
		ones, remain standing of the great temple supposed to be of Neptune;
		the rest are prostrate; and all lying in one direction, bear evidence that
		they have been thrown down by an earthquake.</p>

		<p>The first temple is Grecian Doric, as are all those of which I shall
		speak. Its columns are about eleven feet across, and they must have
		been, including their capitals, more than sixty feet high. Above these
		lofty columns was placed the architrave, one of the stones of which, that
		we measured, was twenty-five feet in length, eight in height, and six in
		thickness; but another is still larger; forty feet long, seven broad, and
		three deep. To transport these enormous masses of stone from their
		quarry, which is several miles distant, with a deep valley and river intervening,
		would trouble the modern engineer; but to poise and place
		them on the top of the columns, seventy feet from the ground, with our
		mechanical means, were indeed a great feat. The columns were not of
		single pieces, but composed of several, and they now lie, to use an unpoetical
		phrase, like rows of enormous cheeses. The great temple was
		three hundred and thirty-four feet long, one hundred and fifty-four wide;
		its porticoes at each end were four columns in depth, eight in width; a
		double row on the sides of the cella or interior edifice, which in all Grecian
		temples was the sanctum sanctorum. In <em>all</em>, there must have been
		eighty columns. There is one remarkable feature about this temple,
		which is, that none of the columns were fluted except those of the eastern
		end. About thirty paces from this ruin, which the Sicilians call
		the Pileri di Giganti, or Pillars of the Giants, are the remains of another
		temple which was about two hundred feet long: its entablature was supported
		by thirty-six fluted columns of seven feet in diameter and thirty-five
		feet long, each of a single piece of stone. Only a few fragments
		of the columns remain standing in their places. Treading another
		thirty paces, you come to a temple which is of rather larger dimensions
		than the one last mentioned. The columns of this were also fluted,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238"></a>238</span>but no part of the edifice is standing, except a solitary pilaster, which
		was probably a portion of the cella. These temples were built of a
		hard but porous stone, of a light color, and were probably covered with
		a thin coat of cement. They command an extensive view both of sea
		and land, and in their primal days must, with their tower-like columns,
		their sculptured entablatures and pediments, have risen above the scene
		in majestic grandeur.</p>

		<p>Three quarters of a mile from these temples was the ancient port,
		now choked with sand, and near it are the remains of edifices supposed
		to have been the magazines. On an adjoining hill are remnants of
		three temples and two towers, in almost undistinguishable ruin. We
		left Selinunte with a lasting but melancholy impression, and were reminded
		of the lines:</p>

		<p>Girgenti, anciently called Agragas and Agrigentum, is situated on the
		southern coast of Sicily, in a delicious country; the modern city was
		built by the Saracens on the summit of a hill upward of eleven hundred
		feet above the level of the sea. The site of the ancient city is
		lower, and about a mile distant. It was probably founded in the eighth
		century before <span class="special_name">Christ</span>. In its flourishing state it contained two hundred
		thousand inhabitants, who were celebrated for their hospitality, their
		love of the arts and luxurious style of living. Plato was so much struck
		with the solidity of their buildings and the sumptuousness of their dinners,
		that he said they &#8216;built as though they thought themselves immortal,
		but ate as though they never expected to eat again.&#8217; The horses of
		Agrigentum were celebrated; and one of the citizens returning from the
		Olympic games, on entering his native town, was followed by three hundred
		chariots, each drawn by four white horses sumptuously caparisoned.
		The government of this little state, whose inhabitants never amounted
		to more than eight hundred thousand, was at first monarchical, afterward
		democratic; but neither the forms of its institutions, nor its riches
		and grandeur, could save it from misfortune: it was besieged several
		times by the Carthaginians, and at length, after a siege of three years,
		was taken and sacked by Hannibal, the son of Giscon. In alluding to
		these misfortunes, the historian says: &#8216;Yet of all the Sicilian cities, the
		fate of Agrigentum seemed the most worthy to be deplored, from the
		striking contrast of its fallen state with its recent splendor and prosperity.
		The natural beauties of Agrigentum were secured by strength
		and adorned with elegance; and whoever considered either the innumerable
		advantages of the city itself, or the gay cultivation of the surrounding
		territory, which abounded in every luxury of the sea and land,
		was ready to pronounce the Agrigentines the most favored inhabitants
		of the earth. The exuberant fertility of the soil, particularly the rich
		luxuriance of the vines and olives, exceeded every thing that is related
		of the happiest climates, and furnished the means of lucrative commerce
		with the populous coast of Africa, which was sparingly provided with those
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>239</span>valuable plants. The extraordinary wealth of the Agrigentines was displayed
		in the magnificence of public edifices and in the splendid enjoyment
		of private fortunes. They had begun and almost completed the
		celebrated Temple of Jupiter, built in the grandest style of architecture,
		employed by the Greeks on the greatest and most solemn occasions.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The ancient city of Agragas stood on an elevated platform or table
		of land, three sides of which fell off in steep precipices; the fourth side
		was surmounted by the lofty hill on which the modern city stands.
		These steep precipices were the natural walls of the city, and were
		made more available for defence by excavation on the inside, so as to
		leave a solid wall of rock rising round the city. On the verge of this
		platform, which gradually sinks from east to west, and on the side next
		the sea, which is about a mile distant, are seen the remains of no fewer
		than six temples. They stood in a general line, but at irregular intervals,
		and must have formed one of the most magnificent spectacles that
		the art of man has ever presented to the eye. The remains of three
		other temples exist, but they lie at a distance from this grand range.
		On the eastern and highest part of the platform, where the natural
		wall of which I have spoken makes an angle, stood the Temple of
		Juno Lucina; next came the Temple of Concord; next the Temple
		of Hercules, near which was the Temple of Jupiter, called of the Giants;
		next came the Temple of Venus, and lastly that of Castor and Pollux.
		The approach to the ruins of these temples from the modern city is over
		the site of the ancient, now shaded by olive, almond, and carruba trees.
		The Temple of Juno is a picturesque ruin; all the columns on the
		northern side are standing, also several at the ends, and part of the entablature;
		the rest of the building, corroded by time or entirely prostrate,
		lies under an exuberant growth of flowers and shrubs.</p>

		<p>Descending from this temple, we pass through a sort of wild garden,
		with here and there an olive-tree or dark carruba; on the left are the
		ruins of the ancient rock-wall, huge fragments of which in places
		have fallen down the precipice; other parts are perforated as with windows
		or loop-holes, or with deep cell-like excavations: these are the
		tombs of the ancient Agrigentines, now tenantless and void. Those
		window-like apertures were evidently made so by the action of the
		elements or the violence of man; and it is related that in consequence
		of the Agrigentines having made their tombs in the walls, they were
		so much weakened that the Carthaginians by means of their engines
		were enabled to batter them down and obtain an entrance. We now
		come to the Temple of Concord, one of the most beautiful specimens of
		Grecian Doric in existence. It is roofless, but otherwise almost perfect.
		It has twenty-four columns; it is, like the temple of Juno, raised on a
		platform of several steps, and about one hundred and fifty-four feet in
		length and fifty-five in breadth. It seems that this temple was used in
		times past for a Christian church, and the sides of its cella are perforated
		by arched openings. The next temple is near one of the ancient
		city gates, and is supposed to have been dedicated to Hercules: it was
		celebrated in ancient times for having in it a fine picture of Alcmena;
		but it is now a confused heap of ruin, with only one column standing,
		which proves it to have been of larger dimensions than the temples just
		mentioned.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>240</span>Turning a little to the right, we come upon the Temple of Jupiter
		Olympius, commonly called of the Giants, the largest sacred edifice in
		Sicily, and one of the most stupendous works of the ancients. It was
		in length three hundred and sixty-eight feet, in breadth one hundred and
		eighty; the breadth or diameter of its columns at the base thirteen feet
		four inches; the height of the columns must have been seventy-five
		feet; above these rose a massive entablature, and the top of the pediments
		could not have been less than one hundred and twenty feet high! The
		grandeur of the door and vestibule corresponded to the simple majesty
		of the whole building, whose sculptured ornaments represented, with the
		finished elegance and laborious accuracy that distinguished each particular
		figure, the &#8216;Defeat of the Giants and the Taking of Troy.&#8217; In
		the interior ranged twenty-four antæ, or square pillars, of fifty feet in
		height; on the top of each was a sculptured giant twenty-seven feet in
		height, which with his hands clasped over his head supported the lofty
		roof. One can scarcely conceive any thing more noble and majestic
		than this wonderful edifice, in comparison with which, though covering
		much more ground, St. Peter&#8217;s in Rome is a splendid gew-gaw. But
		what remains of this great temple? A wide heap of ruin; the interior
		of which, the columns and walls having fallen outward, is a flowery
		field, in which lie some fragments of those huge giants that once supported
		the roof. One of these is tolerably entire: the curls of his hair
		form a sort of garland: it lies with its face upward, and when I stood
		by it, my own head scarcely reached as high as the brow of the statue.
		It is composed of several pieces of stone, as are the columns of this
		temple, and most of the others of Agrigentum. On every side of this
		elevated field lie the walls, entablatures, and columns in enormous fragments:
		the capitals of the columns look like huge rocks that have been
		hurled there by some violent convulsion of nature.</p>

		<p>A short distance from this temple are the ruins of the Temple of Venus,
		and another of Castor and Pollux, of which two of the columns and
		part of the entablature are entire, and the thin coat of cement or stucco
		which covered them is in some parts as perfect as ever. The stone
		of which the temples were constructed is of a very porous nature, a
		sort of tufa, full of sea-shells, and when seen in the sunlight, of a golden
		hue; but they were all covered with stucco, which, judging from what
		remains, was nearly as hard as porcelain, and gave a beautiful and
		finished appearance to the otherwise rude material. Of the other remains
		in Agrigentum, the limits of this article will not allow me to
		speak. But the reader would ask, how came these temples in such a
		state of ruin? On this subject there has been some dispute; but their
		destruction may most reasonably be attributed to a mightier agency
		than man&#8217;s. Earthquake has shattered these gorgeous temples; the
		time <em>when</em> is not recorded. I am inclined to believe that they were
		destroyed, as well as those of Selinus, by the dreadful earthquakes that
		shook Italy and Sicily in the dark age of Valens and Valentinian, three
		hundred and sixty-five years after <span class="special_name">Christ</span>.</p>

		<p>Let us now proceed to Syracuse, once the capital of Sicily, and the
		birth-place of the great Archimedes. It was founded by Archias, one
		of the Heraclidæ, more than seven hundred years before the Christian
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>241</span>era, and according to some authors contained within its walls at one
		time, one million two hundred thousand inhabitants; could maintain an
		army of one hundred thousand foot, ten thousand horse, with a navy of
		five hundred armed vessels. Little now remains of a place once so
		populous and so powerful, save the shrunken modern city of Syracusa,
		containing about nine thousand inhabitants, and a few almost unintelligible
		ruins scattered among vineyards, olive-groves, and fields of corn,
		or over the high wastes of the barren Epipole, on the summit of which
		the curious will find ruined walls and fortresses of massive and beautiful
		masonry. From these the eye commands the whole site of the ancient
		city. <em>There</em> lies, at the distance of three miles, the small island of
		Ortygia, on which is the modern town; on its right is the narrow entrance
		from the sea, which lies beyond, to the greater harbor, that appears
		like a beautiful lake, and is about two miles long and one and a
		half broad. On the left of the island of Ortygia is all that remains of
		the lesser port of Syracuse. On this side the island is connected with
		the main land by means of a draw-bridge. In Ortygia is the famous
		fountain of Arethusa: the spring is yet clear and copious; but the only
		nymphs I was fortunate enough to see were engaged in the necessary
		vocation of cleansing the soiled linen of Syracusa. The remains of a
		beautiful temple of Minerva form a part of the cathedral church. Near
		the small river Anapus are two columns, the remnants of a temple of
		Jupiter, which once contained a statue of that god, wearing a robe of
		gold; but Dionysius the tyrant stripped it off, saying &#8216;it was too cold
		for winter and too hot for summer.&#8217; Among the seats of a noble theatre
		now stands a mill, that is supplied with water diverted from an ancient
		aqueduct close by: a strange metamorphosis indeed! This aqueduct
		conveys the water thirty miles. It may have been of Greek construction
		originally, but that part of it which I have seen is evidently
		Saracenic. The rocky site of Syracuse is in many parts perforated
		with tombs; the roads are literally honey-combed with them. There
		is a street excavated in the limestone rock which on either side is full
		of cells, and it may indeed be said of Syracuse that it is a great burying-ground.
		The oranges, vines, and figs of Syracuse are still flourishing,
		and the earth yet yields its hundred fold; but its glory is departed, and
		the traveller looks in vain for satisfactory vestiges of that mighty city.</p>

		<p>There are many other interesting remains of antiquity in Sicily, but
		I must hasten to a conclusion. I trust the reader will have found the
		subject of this article interesting, although treated briefly and imperfectly.
		The traveller is unworthy of his privilege, and forgetful of duty
		if he extracts not from the scenes described some moral lesson or religious
		truth. The reader has accompanied me in imagination through
		classic Sicily. He has seen the lonely temple of Segeste, standing
		among the mountains like a widowed thing, mourning in silence the
		departed. Where is the multitude that once thronged around its walls?
		Mount Erix still battles with the clouds, as in the days of Agathocles.
		He has clambered with me among the prostrate columns of Selinunte:
		<em>once</em>, from beneath those massive porticoes, the Selinuntine, in the pride
		of his heart, looked upon the crowded port and distant mountains as we
		look on the Hudson, with its white sails and swift steamers, and the
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>242</span>neighboring hills. Where and what are they? The distant mountains
		stand, but the great works which he erected to be a living honor to his
		name and country, are perished forever. He has lingered with me
		among the ruins of the splendid Agrigentum. Its numerous temples
		are dilapidated, or crumbling on the earth; its walls, once its vaunted
		strength, are strewed in shattered fragments on the steeps around. The
		dust of its multitudes serves to fertilize the soil of its ancient site! But
		the stream still flows which gave its name to the city, and the hills
		around yet produce the oil, the wine, and the grain. We have sojourned
		for a time among the melancholy vestiges of Syracuse; the scene
		of battles far more bloody than this land has ever known. The army
		which the Athenians, inflated with pride and presumption, sent against
		Syracuse, was here defeated. In yonder land-locked bay the Athenian
		fleet, the mightiest that republic had ever sent forth, and which they
		believed <em>invincible</em>, was destroyed. And the Roman orator has eloquently
		said, that not only the navy of Athens, but the glory and the
		empire of that republic, suffered shipwreck in the fatal harbor of
		Syracuse. It was there the wonderful mechanical skill of Archimedes
		was displayed against the Roman fleet, and those quiet waters have been
		strewed with the dying and the dead. From this deserted citadel, called
		of &#8216;Labdalus,&#8217; the eye embraces the whole site of the once populous
		Syracuse; and what does it behold? On the distant island of Ortygia,
		an insignificant town, with a few small craft at anchor in the bay;
		nearer, a desert of rocky hills, a goat-herd, and a few straggling goats.
		Turning away from the melancholy scene, we behold afar off the snow-clad
		Ætna. What a contrast is this to what we have just reviewed in
		the mind&#8217;s eye! <em>That</em> is the work of God! Since its huge pyramid
		arose, nation after nation has possessed its fertile slopes. The Siculi
		have labored on its sides; the Greek, the Carthaginian and the Roman;
		the Norman and the Saracen have struggled for mastery at its foot; but
		the roar of the battle is past; the chariot and the charioteer are mingled
		in the dust. Yet yon earth-born giant, fed by continual fires, each century
		augments, and in all probability will continue to do so until</p>

		<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&#8216;The cloud-capt towers, the gorgeous palaces,</p>
		<p>The solemn temples, yea the great globe itself</p>
		<p>Shall dissolve, and like the baseless fabric</p>
		<p>Of a vision, leave not a wreck behind!&#8217;</p>
		</div>
		</div>

		<p>May we not in these things read deep lessons applicable to ourselves?
		The history of the people whose noble works I have endeavored to describe,
		should in the first place teach us how noble a thing it is to construct
		works of beauty and utility, not only for our own gratification,
		but for the benefit of posterity also. The selfish and unreflecting, even
		the modern utilitarian, will perhaps laugh at the thought, and say:
		&#8216;What folly to undertake such labors for the benefit of posterity! We will
		labor for ourselves.&#8217; I would ask such persons, what would have been
		our state if the ancients had entertained such grovelling notions? Do
		they not know that most of the elegant as well as the useful, is the rich
		bequest of these ancients whom they affect to despise? There is not in
		the whole city of New-York a house, however lowly, but in some part
		of it I could point out a moulding or an ornament that comes from the
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>243</span>ancients. But there are other points of view perhaps of higher consequence.
		Their temples were erected to the gods; mistaken as they
		were in their religious notions, we Christians may be put to shame by
		the devotion of the pagan. Not to man were their temples erected.
		Man enjoyed their beauty; gazed with admiration on their exquisite
		forms, and lingered under their shady porticoes; but the eye of the god
		to whom each temple was dedicated was supposed to be on the work,
		and the aim of the builders was perfection in every part; and even that
		which the eye of the multitude never rested on, was finished with elaborate
		care. I would ask, is there such a lofty feeling among us? Are
		we willing to expend toil and cost on that which will never gratify our
		senses? You will answer no. Is not this then a lesson to us? Another
		view of the matter: These works of art were the objects of veneration
		and love; city vied with city in their construction; it was a
		noble emulation&#8212;think you not <em>nobler</em> than the competition for sordid
		gold? The citizen gazed with pride upon the marble triumphs of his
		native place; he loved it more than ever, and felt his patriotism kindle
		as he gazed.</p>

		<p>Let us not think that rail-roads and canals are the only works worthy
		of modern civilization. If we look to intents, (and what ought we to
		look at?) I doubt much but the ancients rose superior to us. We are
		in the enjoyment of many advantages of which they knew nothing. The
		wonder-working press was unknown to them; and above all, the beautiful
		light of Christianity had not been shed on the world. We have the
		broad day; they wrought in the twilight gloom. What majestic monuments
		of art! what enduring legacies of beauty! what objects to make
		a man love his country more and more, could have been erected with
		the means expended a few years ago in reckless speculations! Instead
		of turning with melancholy loathing to those broken bubbles on which
		the hopes and fortunes of many of us were suspended, we could at least
		look with admiration on the marble pile, and exclaim, &#8216;I also can be
		proud of the genius and taste of my country!&#8217; Another lesson we may
		learn from the fate of ancient states: it is to beware of presumptuous
		pride and overweening conceit: these are the result of inconsiderate
		ignorance. It was through presumptuous pride that Athens fell, as I
		have before intimated. We have reason to fear there are many,
		some unconscious of the injury they do, and perhaps with just intentions,
		who feed this appetite for undue praise. Others, for mere popularity or
		the applause of the day, minister with adroitness the sweet though poisonous
		morsel for which our vanity and self-love are open-mouthed; which
		(to carry on the simile,) puffs us up with the comfortable notion that
		we are superior in every respect to all other nations, ancient or modern.
		It would be well to turn a deaf ear to this syren&#8217;s song: let us learn if
		possible to <em>know</em> ourselves; let us remember that there is no perfection,
		either in men or their institutions; and by avoiding a vain and presumptuous
		spirit, and scanning with a careful eye the causes of the greatness
		which under Providence we possess, we shall be most likely to approach
		the perfection which we all desire. We can have little doubt that the
		Agrigentine considered the institutions of his country as perfect as we
		do ours; and the citizens of greater states, Athens, even Rome itself, indulged
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>244</span>in the same pleasing thought. Our only means of judging of the
		future is the past. We see that nations have sprung from obscurity,
		risen to glory, and decayed. Their rise has in general been marked
		by virtue; their decadence by vice, vanity, and licentiousness. Let
		us beware!</p>

		<p>I would not have the reader censure me for commencing this article
		as a traveller and ending it with an attempt to moralize. In reviewing in
		my mind the interesting scenes I have endeavored to describe, I have
		been led back to the thoughts that arose when I trode among the ruins of
		prostrate temples, and they were <em>connected</em> in my mind; and I will venture
		again to say, that he is unworthy of the privilege of travelling who
		gleans not from the fields he visits some moral lesson or religious truth.</p>

		<h2 class="title">THE QUOD CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>

		<h3 class="subtitle fancy">Harry Harson.</h3>

		<h4 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XXII.</h4>
		<p><span class="first_word">It</span> was not the failure of his plans, nor the dread of detection, which
		broke Rust down. He had been prepared for that, and had nerved
		himself to meet it; but it was a blow coming from a quarter where he
		had not dreamed of harm, and wounding him where alone he could
		feel a pang, that crushed him. There was something so abject in the
		prostration of that iron-willed man, who had often endured what would
		have wrung the very souls of other men, without exhibiting any other
		feeling than contempt, that for a moment awed even the hard man who
		had struck the blow. In proportion as Rust&#8217;s control over his emotions
		had been great, so now the reäction was terrible. He seemed paralyzed
		in body and mind. No cry escaped him, but his breath rattled as he
		drew it; his long hair hung loosely over his face, and upon the floor;
		his eyes were closed; his features livid and distorted; and but for his
		struggling breath, and the spasmodic jerking of his fingers, he seemed
		dead.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Lift him up, Bill,&#8217; said Grosket, in a subdued tone. &#8216;It&#8217;s been too
		much for him. Who&#8217;d have thought he had a heart?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Jones smiled grimly, as he said: &#8216;I&#8217;m glad you did it, Mr. Grosket.
		It was better than murdering him. He wasn&#8217;t afeard of dying. Is it
		a fit he&#8217;s got?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Without waiting for a reply, he placed his arms under him and raised
		him up. Rust lay heavily against him, his head falling back, and his
		arms dangling at his side. They carried him to the bench, and placed
		him on it, Grosket standing behind him, and supporting his back.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I guess he&#8217;s done for,&#8217; said Jones, pushing the hair from his face;
		&#8216;pity it wasn&#8217;t three days ago&#8212;that&#8217;s all.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Get some water, or brandy,&#8217; said Grosket; &#8216;I suppose we may as
		well bring him to. It would be an ugly business if he should die on
		our hands.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Jones stooped down, and picking up his great coat, commenced
		fumbling in its pocket, and drew out the bottle from which he and
		Craig had drank, as they were starting on their expedition on the previous
		night. He held it up and looked at it, then muttered: &#8216;It&#8217;s no
		use; it&#8217;s no use.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;What are you talking about, there?&#8217; demanded Grosket, impatiently:
		&#8216;is it empty?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Jones shook it.</p>

		<p>&#8216;No; there&#8217;s a drop or two in it. <span class="keep_together">D&#8212;n</span> him! I don&#8217;t like his
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>246</span>drinking out of this bottle, I don&#8217;t; I use it myself; and blow me, if
		I don&#8217;t think his mouth &#8217;ud p&#8217;ison it.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Grosket cut his scruples short by taking the bottle from him, uncorking
		it, and pouring its contents in Rust&#8217;s mouth.</p>

		<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a waste,&#8217; muttered Jones, eyeing his proceedings with a very
		dissatisfied look. &#8216;I begrudged it to poor Tim; and cuss <em>him</em>, it&#8217;s
		going down <em>his</em> gullet! I hope it&#8217;ll choke him.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Grosket paid no attention to him, but supported Rust, occasionally
		shaking him by way of stirring up his ideas. Either the liquor or the
		shakings had an effect; for the deadly paleness gradually disappeared
		from Rust&#8217;s face; his breath grew less short and gasping; and finally
		he sat up, and looked about him. His eye was wandering and vacant,
		and sad and heart-broken indeed was his tone.</p>

		<p>&#8216;My own dear child!&#8217; said he, in a voice so mild and winning, and
		so teeming with fondness, that none would have recognized it as Rust&#8217;s.
		&#8216;I&#8217;ve had a strange dream, my poor little Mary, about you, whom I
		have garnered up in my heart of hearts.&#8217;</p>

		<p>His voice sank until his words were unintelligible, and then he
		laughed feebly, and passed his hand backward and forward in the air,
		as if caressing the head of a child. &#8216;Your eyes are very bright, my
		little girl, but they beam with happiness; and so they shall, always.
		So they shall&#8212;so they shall. Kiss me, my own darling!&#8217; He extended
		his arms, and drew them toward him, as if they enfolded the
		child, and then bending down his cheek, rocked to and fro, and sang a
		song, such as is used in lulling an infant to sleep.</p>

		<p>&#8216;My God! He&#8217;s clean gone mad!&#8217; said Jones, staring at him with
		starting eyes. &#8216;Dished and done up in ten minutes! That&#8217;s what I
		call going to Bedlam by express.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Although Grosket uttered not a word of comment, his keen gray eye,
		bright as a diamond; his puckered brows; his compressed lips, and
		his hands tightly clasped together, showed that he viewed his work
		with emotions of the most powerful kind. At length he said, in low
		tone, as if communing with himself rather than addressing the only
		person who seemed capable of hearing him: &#8216;If he goes mad he&#8217;ll
		spoil my scheme. He&#8217;ll not reap the whole harvest that I have sown
		for him. He must live; ay, and in his sane mind, to feel its full bitterness.
		I, <em>I</em> have lived,&#8217; said he, striking his breast; &#8216;<em>I</em> have borne
		up against the same curse that now is on him. <em>I</em> have had the same
		feeling gnawing at my heart, giving me no rest, no peace. <em>He</em> must
		suffer. He <em>must</em> not take refuge from himself in madness. He <em>shall</em>
		not,&#8217; said he, savagely. &#8216;Ha! ha! who would have thought that the
		flint which the old fellow calls his heart had feeling in it?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Whether these remarks reached Rust&#8217;s ear, or whether it was that
		his mind, after the first shock of the intelligence was over, was beginning
		to rally, is a matter of doubt; but from some cause or other, he suddenly
		discontinued his singing, passed his hand across his forehead, held
		his long hair back from his face, and stared about him; his eye wandering
		from Grosket to Jones, and around the room, and then resting on
		the floor. He sat for some time looking steadfastly down, his face
		gradually regaining its stern, unbending character; his thin lips compressing
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>247</span>themselves, until his mouth had assumed its usual expression
		of bitterness, mingled with resolution.</p>

		<p>The two men watched, without speaking, the progress of this metamorphosis.
		At last he rose, and turning to Grosket, said in a calm voice:</p>

		<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ve done your worst; yet you see Michael Rust can bear it;&#8217;
		and then bowing to him, he said: &#8216;Good bye, Enoch. Whatever may
		have happened to <em>my</em> child, <em>I</em> am blameless. <em>I</em> never sold her happiness
		to gratify my avarice. If she has become what Enoch&#8217;s child was, the
		sin does not lie at <em>my</em> door. I don&#8217;t know how it is with <em>you</em>.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Turning to Jones, he said, in the same quiet tone: &#8216;Murderer of
		your bosom-friend, good bye.&#8217; The door closed, and he was gone.</p>

		<p>A bitter execration from the two men followed him. From Jones, it
		burst forth in unbridled fury, and he sprang forward to avenge the
		taunt, but was withheld by Grosket, who grasped his arm, then as suddenly
		relinquished his hold, and said:</p>

		<p>&#8216;Quick! quick! Jones. Drag him back! It concerns your safety
		and my plans to get him back.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The man dashed to the door and down the stairs. In a moment he
		reäppeared:</p>

		<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s too late. He&#8217;s in the street.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Curse it! that was a blunder! We should have searched him. He
		carries all his papers with him.&#8217;</p>

		<p>But almost at the same moment he seemed to overcome his vexation,
		for he said: &#8216;Well, it can&#8217;t be helped, so there&#8217;s no use in grumbling
		about it. And now, Bill Jones,&#8217; said he, turning to the other, &#8216;you
		know what you&#8217;ve done, and who set you on. So do I. He&#8217;s worse
		than you are. If you were him, I&#8217;d arrest you on the spot. As it is,
		I say you had better make yourself scarce. Your neck is in danger, for
		although the death of Tim, if the rumor is true, was <span class="keep_together">accidental&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;</span></p>

		<p>&#8216;It was, it <em>was</em>, Mr. Grosket,&#8217; interrupted Jones. &#8216;<span class="keep_together">D&#8212;n</span> it, if it
		was Rust, if it was only <em>him</em>, I wouldn&#8217;t mind it. I&#8217;d die myself, to
		see <em>him</em> swing.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Well, hear me,&#8217; continued Grosket. &#8216;You were committing a felony
		when you killed Craig, and his death, although accidental, is murder.
		I&#8217;m no lawyer, but I know <em>that</em>. You must run for it.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I&#8217;d cuss all danger,&#8217; said Jones, gnawing his lip, &#8216;if I could only
		lug Rust in it too.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Well, well,&#8217; returned Grosket, &#8216;you must take your own course; but
		remember I&#8217;ve warned you. You have some good traits about you,
		Bill, and that&#8217;s more than Rust has. Good bye!&#8217; He extended his
		hand to the burglar. Jones grasped it eagerly.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Thank you! thank you, Mr. Grosket,&#8217; said he, the tears starting to
		his eyes. &#8216;If you only knew how I was brought up, how I suffered,
		what has made me what I am, you wouldn&#8217;t think so hard of me as
		some do. But there is blood on me, now; that&#8217;s worse than all. I&#8217;ll
		never get over <em>that</em>. I might, if it wasn&#8217;t Tim&#8217;s. Good bye, God
		bless ye, Mr. Grosket! My blessing won&#8217;t do you much good, but it
		can&#8217;t hurt you.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Grosket shook his hand, and left the room; and the desperate man,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>248</span>whom he left melted by a transient word of kindness, which had found
		its way to his rugged heart, buried his face in his hands, and wept.</p>

		<p>Once in the street, Rust endeavored to bear up against his fortune.
		But he could not. His mind was confused, and all his thoughts were
		strange, fantastic and shadowy. He paused; dashed his hand impatiently
		against his forehead, and endeavored to shake off the spell. No,
		no! it would not leave him. Failure in his schemes! dishonor in his
		child! He could think of them, and of <em>them</em> only. Once on this theme,
		his mind became more bewildered than ever; and yielding himself to
		its impulses, he fell into a slow pace, and sauntered on, with his chin
		bent down on his breast.</p>

		<p>From the thickly-settled parts of the town he went on, until he came
		to streets where the bustle and crowd were less; then to others, which
		were nearly deserted; then on he went, until he reached a quarter
		where the houses stood far apart, with vacant lots between them. Still
		he kept on. Then came fields, and cottages, and farm-houses, surrounded
		by tall trees. Still on he went, still wading through a mass of
		chaotic fancies, springing up, and reeling and flitting through his mind;
		shadows of things that had been, and might be; ghosts of the past;
		prophets of the future. He had become a very child. At last he stood
		on the bank of the river; and then for the first time he seemed to
		awaken from his trance.</p>

		<p>It was a glorious day, whose sunshine might have found its way even
		into his black heart. Oh! how soft, and mellow, and pure, the hurricane
		of the last night had left it! Not a cloud in the sky, not a breath to
		ripple the water, or to wave the long trailing locks of the hoary willows,
		which nodded over its banks.</p>

		<p>Rust looked about him, with a bewildered gaze, until his eye became
		fixed upon the water. &#8216;It&#8217;s very quiet, <em>very</em> quiet,&#8217; said he; &#8216;I wonder
		if a man, once engulfed in it, feels peace.&#8217; He pressed his hand to his
		breast, and muttered: &#8216;<em>Here</em> it is gone forever!&#8217;</p>

		<p>He loitered listlessly on, under the trees. His step was feeble; and
		he stooped and tottered, as if decrepid. He stopped again, shook his
		head, and went on, looking upon the ground, and at times long and
		wistfully at the river.</p>

		<p>An old man, leaning on a stout cane, who had been watching him, at
		last came up. Raising his hat, as he did so, he said:</p>

		<p>&#8216;You seem, like myself, to be an admirer of this noble river?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rust looked up at him sharply, ready to gather in his energies, if
		necessary. But there was nothing in the mild, dignified face of the
		speaker to invite suspicion, and he replied in a feeble tone:</p>

		<p>&#8216;Yes, yes; it is a noble river.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve seen many, in my long life,&#8217; said the other, &#8216;and have never
		met its equal.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rust paused, as if he did not hear him, and then continued in a
		musing tone:</p>

		<p>&#8216;How smooth it is! how calm! Many have found peace there, who
		never found it in life. Drowning&#8217;s an easy death, I&#8217;m told.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The stranger replied gravely, and even sternly:</p>

		<p>&#8216;They have escaped the troubles of life, and plunged into those of
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>249</span>eternity;&#8217; and then, as if willing to give Rust an opportunity of
		explaining away the singular character of the remark, he said: &#8216;I
		hope <em>you</em> do not meditate suicide?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; replied Rust, quietly, &#8216;not at present; but I&#8217;ve often thought
		that many a wrecked spirit will find <em>there</em> what it never found on
		earth&#8212;peace.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;The body may,&#8217; returned the other, &#8216;but not the soul.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rust smiled doubtfully, and walked off. The man watched, and
		even followed him; but seeing him turn from the river, he took another
		direction, occasionally pausing to look back. Not so Rust. From the
		time he had parted with the stranger, he had forgotten him, and his
		thoughts wandered back to their old theme. It was strange that he
		should believe so implicitly Grosket&#8217;s tale, coming as it did from one
		whom he knew hated him. Yet he <em>did</em> believe it. There was proof
		of its truth in Grosket&#8217;s manner; in his look; in his tone of assured
		triumph. Yet although Rust brooded over nothing else that livelong
		day, he could not realize it; he could not appreciate how desolate and
		lonely he was. He could only fancy how life would be, if what Grosket
		had told him <em>had</em> happened. &#8216;This is not all a dream, I suppose,&#8217;
		muttered he, pausing as he went, and passing his hand across his forehead.
		&#8216;No, no; I&#8217;m awake&#8212;wide awake; and <em>I</em> am Michael Rust;
		that&#8217;s more strange than all.&#8217;</p>

		<p>After hours of wandering, he found himself at his office. He ascended
		the stairs, opened the door, and went in. It was dark, for the lights
		had been twinkling in the shop-windows before he left the street; but
		he sat down without observing it; and there he remained until Kornicker
		came in with a light.</p>

		<p>Rust made no reply to the salutation which he received. Kornicker
		placed the light on the table; and after loitering round the room, and
		busying himself with a few papers which he had arranged on the table,
		to give it a business-like appearance, he asked:</p>

		<p>&#8216;Do you want me any more, to-night?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;No; you may go.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The dismissal and departure of Mr. Kornicker were almost simultaneous.
		His heavy foot went thumping from step to step, and finally
		the street-door banged after him. Rust sat without moving, listening to
		every tramp of his heavy foot, until the door shut it out.</p>

		<p>&#8216;So, he&#8217;s gone,&#8217; said he, drawing a long breath, and cuddling himself
		up on his chair. &#8216;He&#8217;ll be in my way no more to-night.&#8217;</p>

		<p>He shivered slightly; and then got up and drew his chair nearer the
		grate, although there was no fire in it. &#8216;And <em>this</em> is then the end of my
		scheme,&#8217; muttered he; &#8216;I have gone on for years in the same beaten
		track, fighting off all who could interfere with me. The affection of
		those who would have loved me; friends, relatives, those nearest to me,
		with the same blood in our veins, nursed in the same arms, who drew
		life from the same source; this cold heart has repulsed, until they have
		all abandoned me!&#8217;</p>

		<p>He leaned his head on his hands, and tears, scalding tears, gushed
		from his eyes. &#8216;I did it for <em>her</em>. It was to get gold to lavish on <em>her</em>.
		I would have chained myself for life to that old man&#8217;s daughter, to get
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>250</span>wealth; I would have added the murder of those children to the catalogue
		of my crimes, that I might have grasped their inheritance, to have
		showered all that I had gathered by toil and crime upon <em>her</em>. She was
		my hope, my pride, my own dear darling child; but she is shipwrecked
		now; she has withered my heart. I would have shed its last blood for
		her. I would&#8212;I <em>would</em>; indeed I would! But it&#8217;s useless to think of
		it. She can never be what she was; the bright, pure-souled, spotless
		child whom I worshipped. Yes, yes; I <em>did</em> worship her; Why deny
		it? Better, far better, she had died, for then I might still have cherished
		her memory. It&#8217;s too late. She&#8217;s become a castaway now.&#8217;</p>

		<p>He paused. From a state of deep and querulous despondency, he
		gradually recovered composure; then his mood grew sterner and
		sterner; until his compressed lips and flashing eye showed that he had
		passed from one extreme to the other.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Is there nothing left to live for?&#8217; exclaimed he; &#8216;<em>nothing</em> left? One
		thing can yet be done. I must ascertain her disgrace beyond a doubt.
		Then atonement can and shall be made, or <em>he</em> had better never have been
		born!&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rust stood up, with an expression of bold, honest indignation, such
		as he had rarely worn, stamped on every feature. &#8216;<em>This</em> must be
		accomplished,&#8217; said he. &#8216;Everything else must be abandoned: <em>this</em>
		done, let me die; for I cannot love her as I did, and I might hate her:
		Better die!&#8217;</p>

		<h4 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER TWENTY-THIRD.</h4>

		<p>Richard Holmes, Esq. was sitting in his office, two days after the
		events narrated in the last chapter, with his nose within a few inches
		of a law-book which rested on his knees, when he was aroused by the
		opening of the door, and the entrance of a man. Holmes was so much
		out of the world, and out of the current of business, that he did what a
		practitioner at the bar of his age and standing rarely does; that is, he
		looked up without waiting till he was addressed.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Ah, Harson?&#8212;it&#8217;s you, is it?&#8217; said he, laying aside his book, but
		without rising.</p>

		<p>Harry walked up, shook hands with him, and seated himself.</p>

		<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ve been hard at work, and have made some progress,&#8217; said he,
		taking off his hat, and placing it on the table. &#8216;We&#8217;ve got the woman.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;What woman?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Blossom,&#8217; replied Harson; &#8216;I&#8217;ve brought her here to answer for
		herself. She was in Rust&#8217;s employ, and received the children from
		him. She&#8217;s below.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;What news of the boy?&#8217; inquired Holmes.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Grosket is after him. He knows where he is. Would you like to
		see the woman?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;It would be as well,&#8217; said Holmes, drumming on the table. &#8216;We&#8217;ll
		hear what she has to say. Does she communicate what she knows
		willingly or under compulsion?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s not very talkative;&#8217; answered Harson, &#8216;and seems terribly
		afraid of Rust.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>251</span>&#8216;I think we can squeeze the truth out of her,&#8217; replied Holmes.
		&#8216;Bring her up.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Harson went out, and in a few minutes reäppeared with Mrs. Blossom
		at his heels. The lawyer pointed to a chair, into which the lady
		sank, apparently in a state of great exhaustion and agitation; for she
		moaned and rocked to and fro, and wrung her hands.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Your name&#8217;s Blossom, I think,&#8217; said Holmes, evincing no sympathy
		whatever with her sufferings.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Ah&#8217;s me! ah&#8217;s me! I&#8217;m very old! I&#8217;m very old!&#8217; exclaimed the
		lady, moaning from the very bottom of her lungs, but without making
		any reply to the question.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Hark ye,&#8217; said Holmes, in a stern tone, &#8216;I have not sent for you, to
		listen to your moaning, nor to be trifled with in any other way. You
		have come here to disclose the deeds of a scoundrel; and disclose them
		you <em>must</em>. You shall answer all my questions, truly, honestly, and
		without equivocation, or it will be the worse for you. I am aware of
		offences committed by you, which, if punished as they merit, would
		send you to prison. I tell you this, that you may know exactly how
		we stand with reference to each other. If you wish to serve yourself,
		you will find true and prompt replies to whatever I ask. What&#8217;s your
		name?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Mrs. Blossom oscillated in her chair, glanced at the wall, replied
		&#8216;Blossom,&#8217; and buried her face in a rag of a shawl.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Good! Where do you live?&#8217; demanded the lawyer. The woman
		answered, and Holmes wrote it down.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Do you know a man by the name of Michael Rust?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Mrs. Blossom&#8217;s chair became very uneasy, and she was seized with
		a violent cough. The lawyer waited until her cough was better, and
		repeated the question, accompanying it by a look which produced an
		answer in the affirmative.</p>

		<p>&#8216;What other name did you ever know him to bear?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Mrs. Blossom suddenly found her voice, and replied boldly: &#8216;No
		other;&#8217; and here she spoke the truth; for Rust had trusted her no
		farther than was absolutely necessary.</p>

		<p>&#8216;How long have you known him?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Mrs. Blossom again lost her voice, but found it instantly on meeting
		the eye of Holmes; and she answered bluntly, &#8216;About four years.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;What led to your acquaintance?&#8217;</p>

		<p>The woman cast a shrewd suspicious glance at him, as if calculating
		how far she might trifle with impunity; but there was something in his
		manner that was not encouraging, and she replied, &#8216;that she could not
		remember.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Holmes laid down his pen, and pushing back his chair so that he
		faced her, said in a quiet but very decided manner:</p>

		<p>&#8216;Mrs. Blossom, you have been brought here for the purpose of giving
		us such information as will enable us to do justice to a person who has
		been greatly injured by this man Rust. I mention this, not because I
		suppose the motive will have any great weight with you, but to let you
		see that the object of our investigation is nothing against yourself.
		Your answers are important to us; for at present we know no other
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>252</span>than yourself, of whom we can obtain the information we require. I
		do not conceal this, nor will I conceal the fact that unless you <em>do</em> answer
		me, you shall leave this room for a prison. I told you so before; I
		repeat it now; I will <em>not</em> repeat it a third time. I already know enough
		of the matter on which I am interrogating you, to be able to detect
		falsehood in your answers.&#8217;</p>

		<p>There was something either in the words of the lawyer or in the
		formation of her chair that caused Mrs. Blossom to move very uneasily;
		and at the same time to cast a glance behind her, as if there existed a
		strong connection between her thoughts and the door. She was however
		used to trying circumstances, and did not lose her presence of mind.
		She made no reply, but sat with every faculty, which long training had
		sharpened to a high degree of cunning, on the alert; but she was not
		a little taken by surprise when Holmes, after taking from the table a
		packet of papers, selected one, and having spent a few minutes in
		examining it, said to her:</p>

		<p>&#8216;To convince you that we are perfectly acquainted with the nature
		of your dealings with Rust, I will enter into a few details, which may
		perhaps enable you to recollect something more. Four years since, on
		the sixteenth of December, a man by the name of Blossom, with whom
		you lived, and whose name you bear, although you are not his wife,
		proposed to you to take charge of two children, a boy and girl. At first
		you refused, but finally agreed to do it on receiving five hundred dollars,
		and the assurance that no inquiry would be made as to the treatment
		they received at your hands, and that whether they lived or died was
		a matter of indifference to the person who placed them in your charge,
		and would not be too closely investigated. The children came. They
		were quite young. You had them for a week, and were then informed
		that they must go, for a time, to the country. You asked no questions,
		but gave them up, and they were sent away, the money for their support
		being furnished by the same hand that threw them upon your mercy.
		In a year or so they were brought back, and were again entrusted to
		you, with instructions to break them down, and if possible to send them
		to their graves; but if their bodies were proof against cruelty, <em>then</em> so
		to pollute their very souls, and familiarize them with crime, that they
		should forget what they had been; and that even those who should
		have loved them best would blush to see what they were. You began
		your work well, for you had a stern, savage master over you&#8212;Michael
		Rust. Thus much,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I know; but I must know more. You
		must identify the children as the same first delivered to you by Rust.
		You must disclose the names of the persons with whom they lived in
		the country. You must also give me such information as will enable
		us to fasten this crime on Rust. Another person could have proved
		all this&#8212;the man Blossom; but you know he is dead.&#8217;</p>

		<p>He paused, for Mrs. Blossom&#8217;s face grew deadly pale as he spoke.
		It was momentary, however; and might have passed away entirely,
		had not a strange suspicion fastened itself on his mind. He added in a
		slow tone: &#8216;What ailed him, <em>you</em> know best.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Mrs. Blossom&#8217;s thin lips grew perfectly white; and moved as if she
		were attempting to speak.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>253</span>&#8216;Will you give me the information I require? or will you accept the
		alternative?&#8217; said Holmes, still keeping his eye upon her.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Go on; what do you want?&#8217; demanded she, in a quick husky voice.</p>

		<p>&#8216;You are acquainted with Michael Rust?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I am,&#8217; replied she, in the same quick, nervous manner.</p>

		<p>&#8216;How did you first become acquainted with him?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;You know all that,&#8217; was the abrupt reply. &#8216;Why should I go over
		it again? It&#8217;s all true, as you said it.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Holmes paused to make a note of it, and then asked:</p>

		<p>&#8216;What is the name of the person, in the country, who took charge of
		the children?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; replied the woman. &#8216;Michael Rust sent a man for
		them, who took them off.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Who was this man?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know; I never saw him. Mr. Blossom gave the children
		to him, and never told me his name.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Good,&#8217; said Holmes, in his short, abrupt manner: &#8216;Where are
		these children now?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;One&#8217;s at <em>his</em> house,&#8217; replied she, pointing to Harson. &#8216;The other,
		by this time, is with a man named Grosket. He&#8217;s been arter him, and
		I suppose has got him by this time.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Enoch Grosket?&#8217; inquired Holmes.</p>

		<p>The woman nodded. &#8216;I told him where he&#8217;d find him. He went
		straight off to fetch him.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Will you swear that they are the same children brought to you four
		years since?&#8217; said Holmes, pausing in his writing, and running his eye
		over the notes which he had made. &#8216;Do you know them to be the
		same?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;The man said so, who brought &#8217;em back at the end of the year.
		That&#8217;s all I know about it. They never left me arter that.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Who was that man?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Tim Craig,&#8217; replied the woman.</p>

		<p>&#8216;And he&#8217;s dead. The only person who could reveal their place of
		concealment during that year, and the name of those who had the care
		of them. The chain is broken, by which to identify them as the lost
		children of George Colton. Who can aid us in this?&#8217;</p>


		<p>&#8216;I <span class="small_all_caps">CAN</span>!&#8217; said a voice.</p>

		<p>All three started, for there, at their very elbow, stood Michael Rust;
		but Rust, fearfully altered, worn down, wan, haggard, with sunken
		cheeks, and features rigid and colorless, as if cut from wax, and with
		an eye of fire. But wrecked as he was, there was still that strange
		sneering smile on his lip, which seemed as if only parting to utter
		sarcasm and mockery. But now he was serious in his mood, for he
		repeated:</p>

		<p>&#8216;I can, and without my aid the secret must be hid forever.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Holmes rose, angrily, from his seat.</p>

		<p>&#8216;What brought <em>you</em> here?&#8217; demanded he.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Be seated, I beg of you,&#8217; said Rust, bowing, and speaking in a low,
		mocking tone. &#8216;What brought me here? <em>You</em> called upon <em>me</em>, I
		think; it was but civil to return the visit. I have come to do so.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>254</span>&#8216;This is idle, Sir,&#8217; replied Holmes, coldly. &#8216;You came for some
		purpose. Name it. The sooner this interview is over, the more
		agreeable I suppose it will be for both of us.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;For me, certainly,&#8217; said Rust, in a manner so constrained and
		different from his usual one, that the lawyer was in doubt whether he
		was in jest or earnest. Then he added, in a bitter tone: &#8216;You ask
		what brought me here. Destiny, folly, revenge perhaps against my
		own heart&#8217;s blood. Call it what you will; here I am; and ready to
		assist in the very matter which now perplexes you. What more do
		you want?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Holmes replied with a sarcastic smile: &#8216;The assistance of Michael
		Rust is likely to be as great as his sincerity. We certainly should
		place great reliance on it.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rust, perfectly unmoved by the taunt, answered in a tone so bitter,
		so full of hatred to himself, so replete with the outpouring of a cankered
		heart, so despairing and reckless, that the lawyer felt that even in him
		there might be some truth:</p>

		<p>&#8216;I care not whether you trust me or not; I care not whether you believe
		me or not. If Michael Rust could ever have been swayed by the
		opinions of others, it would have been before this; it&#8217;s too late to begin
		now. I came here because I have failed in all I undertook; because I
		am beginning to hate the one for whom I have toiled, until I grew gray
		with the wearing away of mind and body; because the soul of life is
		gone. I do it out of revenge against that person. There is no remorse;
		no conscience; but it&#8217;s revenge. Look at me; that person has blasted
		me. Do I not show it in every feature and limb? Now you understand
		me. My schemes are abandoned; and I shall soon be where
		neither man nor law can reach me. My secret can do me no good;
		why should I keep it? Perhaps the recollection of past days and of
		past favors from one whom I have wronged, may have had its weight;
		perhaps not. I&#8217;ve come to tell the truth. If you will hear it, well; if
		not, I go, and it goes with me.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Holmes and Harson exchanged looks, and Harson nodded, as if in
		acquiescence to some proposition which he supposed the looks of the
		other to indicate.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Well, Sir,&#8217; replied Holmes, &#8216;we will hear what you have to say.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Stop,&#8217; said Rust; &#8216;before uttering a word, I must have a promise.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The lawyer looked at him, and then at Harson, as much as to say:
		&#8216;I expected it. There&#8217;s some trick in it.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rust observed it, and said: &#8216;Spare your suspicions; I have come
		here to be frank and honest in word and deed; and Michael Rust can
		be so, when the fancy seizes him. The promise I require is this;
		whatever I may reveal, no matter what the penalty, you will not set the
		blood-hounds of the law on my track within forty-eight hours. I have
		yet one act to perform in the great farce of life. <em>That</em> accomplished,
		you may do your worst.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;This is all very strange,&#8217; said Holmes, eyeing the thin, excited features
		of his visitor, as if not altogether sure of his sanity; &#8216;if you
		fear the punishment of your misdeeds, why reveal them? Why place
		yourself in our power, or run the risk of our interfering with your
		future movements?&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>255</span>Rust replied bitterly: &#8216;You shall hear. My whole life has been spent
		for one person, my own child. Every faculty of mind and body has
		been devoted to her, and every crime I have committed was for her.
		Scruples were disregarded; ties of blood set at defiance; every thing
		that binds man to man, that deters from wrong, were disregarded, if
		they stood in the way of that one grand aim of life. <em>She</em> forgot all!
		She has broken me down, heart and spirit. Love and devotion were
		crushed with them, and revenge has sprung up from their ruins. Ay!
		revenge against my own child! Should any thing prevent my doing
		what I have yet to do, and should my brother die, and his children not
		be found, <em>she</em> would be his heir. <em>I</em> would have labored and <em>succeeded</em>,
		for one who has disgraced me, and made me what you see me!&#8217;</p>

		<p>He stretched out his thin hands, displaying the large veins, coursing
		beneath the skin, and apparently full to bursting. &#8216;How wasted they
		are!&#8217; He smiled as he looked at them, and then asked: &#8216;Will you promise?&#8217;</p>

		<p>The lawyer turned to Harson, and then said: &#8216;I promise; do you,
		Harson?&#8217; Harry nodded.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Good!&#8217; said Rust, abruptly. &#8216;You know my name, and much of
		my history. All the facts which you detailed to me at my office a short
		time since are true&#8212;true almost to the very letter. Michael Rust and
		Henry Colton are one. The plodding, scheming, heartless, unprincipled
		Henry Colton, who could sell his brother&#8217;s own flesh and blood for gold;
		who could forget all the kindnesses heaped upon him, and stab his benefactor,
		and this wreck of Michael Rust, are one!&#8217;</p>

		<p>He struck his hand against his chest, and strode up and down the
		room, biting his lips. &#8216;<em>He</em> was rich, and <em>I</em> was poor: he gave me the
		means of living, but I wanted more. I had my eye on his entire wealth,
		and I wanted him to be in his grave. But he thwarted me in that.
		Feeble and sickly, so that a breath might have destroyed him, he lived
		on, and at last, as if to balk me farther, he married. Two children
		were born; two more obstacles between me and my aim. Two children!&#8212;two
		more of the same blood for me to love. Ho! ho! how
		Michael Rust loved those babes!&#8217; exclaimed he, clutching his fingers
		above his head, and gasping as he spoke. He turned, and fastening his
		glaring eye on the lawyer, griped his fingers together, with his teeth
		hard set and speaking through them, said in a sharp whisper: &#8216;I could
		have strangled them!&#8217;</p>

		<p>He paused; and then went on: &#8216;At last came the thought of removing
		them. At first it was vague: it came like a shadow, and went
		off; then it came again, more distinct. Then it became stronger, and
		stronger, until it grew into a passion&#8212;a very madness. At last my
		mind was made up, and my plans formed. I trusted no one, but carried
		them off myself, and delivered them to the husband of that woman,&#8217;
		pointing to Mrs. Blossom. &#8216;I told him nothing of their history: he was
		paid to take charge of them, and asked no questions. Then came the
		clamor of pursuit. I daily met and comforted my broken-hearted brother
		and his wife: I held out hopes which I knew were false; I offered
		rewards; I turned pursuit in every direction except the right one.
		They both thanked me, and looked upon me as their best friend; and
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256"></a>256</span>so I was, for I kept up hope; and what is life without it? At last the
		search approached the neighborhood where the children really were,
		and they were sent to the country. A man by the name of Craig took
		them. The only person who was in the secret was Enoch Grosket;
		but he knew nothing respecting the history of the children, nor where
		they went.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Where was it?&#8217; inquired Holmes, anxiously, &#8216;and to whom did you
		entrust them?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I have prepared it all,&#8217; said Rust; he drew a letter from his pocket
		and handed it to him. &#8216;You&#8217;ll find it there, and the names of the persons;
		they know nothing of the children; but they can identify them
		as those left with them four years ago; and they still have the clothes
		which they wore at the time; but the girl&#8217;s resemblance to her mother
		will save all that trouble.&#8217;</p>

		<p>He paused, with his dark eyes fastened on the floor, and his lips
		working with intense emotion.</p>

		<p>&#8216;And is it possible that the love of gold can lead one to crimes like
		these!&#8217; said Holmes, in a subdued tone.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Love of gold!&#8217; exclaimed Rust, fiercely; &#8216;what cared I for gold?
		Ho! ho! Michael Rust values gold but as dross; but it is the world;
		the cringing, obsequious, miser-hearted world, that kisses the very feet
		of wealth, which set Michael Rust on; it was this that lashed him forward;
		but not for himself. I married a woman whom I loved,&#8217; said he,
		in a quick, stern tone; &#8216;she abandoned me and became an outcast, and
		paid the penalty by an outcast&#8217;s fate: she died in the streets. The love
		which I bore her I transferred to my child. I was poor, and I resolved
		that she should be rich. Can you understand my motive now? I loved
		my own flesh and blood better than my brother&#8217;s. I have now relinquished
		my plans, and have told you why.&#8217;</p>

		<p>A pause of some moments ensued, and Rust said: &#8216;Is there any thing
		more that you want? If so, tell me at once, for after to-day we shall
		never meet again.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Holmes ran his eye over the papers, and selecting two letters, handed
		them to Rust, and said:</p>

		<p>&#8216;How do you account for the difference of that hand-writing, if Michael
		Rust and Henry Colton are one?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Michael Rust wrote one hand, Henry Colton another,&#8217; said Rust;
		&#8216;but <em>I</em> wrote both.&#8217; He seized a pen, wrote a few words, signed the
		names Michael Rust and Henry Colton, and flung it on the table. &#8216;The
		game had been well studied before it was played.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Your writing is well disguised indeed,&#8217; said the lawyer, comparing
		it with the letters; &#8216;it solves that difficulty.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Any thing else?&#8217; demanded Rust, impatiently; &#8216;my time is
		limited.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Holmes shook his head; but Harson said: &#8216;A few words about Jacob
		Rhoneland.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Well?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;You accuse him of forgery; what does that mean?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;He was a fool: I wanted to marry his daughter; I represented
		myself to him as very rich, to tempt his avarice; that failed. I added
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>257</span>entreaties; <em>they</em> failed. Then I tried the effect of fear. He was not
		deaf to that for a long time, but at last he overcame even that.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;And the tale?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Was well fabricated, but false.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;And Ned Somers?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I had to get rid of him: what could I do while he was dallying
		round the girl? I <em>did</em> get rid of him: a few lies whispered to the old
		man sent him adrift. But I&#8217;m tired of this; I came to tell what I
		pleased, and nothing more, and I must be at work. You must respect
		your promise,&#8217; said he, turning to Holmes.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I shall, and I hope your present errand at least is an honest one.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;It is,&#8217; said Rust, with a strange smile; &#8216;it is to punish a criminal.&#8217;
		He opened the door and went off without another word.</p>

				<p><span class="first_word">Yes</span>! I have been for many a changeful year,</p>
				<p>Studious or sensual, gay or wild, or sad,</p>
				<p>An earnest votary of Evening. She</p>
				<p>Had something wondrous winning to my eye,</p>
				<p>So soft she was, and quiet. Often too,</p>
				<p>Absorbed in books, which were perchance a bane,</p>
				<p>Perchance a blessing; or in glittering crowds,</p>
				<p>Gazing all rapt on woman&#8217;s eloquent face,</p>
				<p>Nature&#8217;s most witching and most treacherous page;</p>
				<p>Or high in mirth with those whose senseful wit</p>
				<p>Outflashed the rosy wines that warmed its flow,</p>
				<p>I&#8217;ve held my vigils till the brow of Night</p>
				<p>Grew pale and starless, and her solemn pomp,</p>
				<p>Out-glared by day, faded in hueless space.</p>
				<p>I do repent me of my worship. Night</p>
				<p>Was given for rest: who breaks this natural law</p>
				<p>Wrongs body and soul alike. One vigorous hour</p>
				<p>Of sober day-light thought is worth a night&#8217;s</p>
				<p>Slow oscitations of a drowsy mind.</p>
				<p>&#8217;Neath Eve&#8217;s pale star the desolate heart reverts</p>
				<p>To those far moments, when the sky was blue,</p>
				<p>And earth was green, as earth and sky to eyes</p>
				<p>Once disenchanted, can appear no more.</p>

			<div class="stanza">
				<p>We <em>all</em> are mourners. Good men must deplore</p>
				<p>Lost hours, lost friends, lost pleasures; and the bad</p>
				<p>Are racked by throes of impotent remorse,</p>
				<p>Dark, fierce, and bitter; for <em>themselves</em> are lost,</p>
				<p>And still neglecting what remains of life,</p>
				<p>They strive by backward reachings to redeem</p>
				<p>The irredeemable. <em>Why</em> pass the hours,</p>
				<p>The fleeting hours, in profitless regrets,</p>
				<p>When each regret but lops <em>another</em> bough,</p>
				<p>Full of green promise, from the tree of life?</p>
				<p>You, who in your bereavement truly feel</p>
				<p>This truth, expressed so sadly and so well:</p>
				<p>&#8216;Joy&#8217;s recollection is no longer joy,</p>
				<p>While Sorrow&#8217;s memory is sorrow still;&#8217;</p>
				<p>I counsel to recant your vows, and come</p>
				<p>With me to worship at a better shrine,</p>
				<p>The shrine of Morning.</p>
				<p class="i22">Morning is the hour</p>
				<p>Of vigorous thought, unconquerable hope,</p>
				<p>And high endeavor. All our powers, in sleep</p>
				<p>Bathed, nurtured, clad, and strung with nerves of steel,</p>
				<p>Rise from their brief oblivion keen with health,</p>
				<p>And strong for struggling, and we feel that toil</p>
				<p>Is toil&#8217;s own recompense. I deem that Man</p>
				<p>Is not a retrospective being; for his course</p>
				<p>Is on, still on; and never should his eyes</p>
				<p>Turn back, but to detect his errors past,</p>
				<p>And shun them in his future steps. Too long,</p>
				<p>Ah! much too long, O world! and oft I&#8217;ve gazed</p>
				<p>In awe and wonder on thy midnight sleep,</p>
				<p>While magic Memory, singly or in groups,</p>
				<p>Upon her faded tablets re-produced</p>
				<p>Fair and familiar forms of Love and Joy.</p>
				<p>Oh! <em>so</em> familiar were they, and so fair,</p>
				<p>Though dim, those blessed faces, that my eyes</p>
				<p>Grew tremulous with the dew of unshed tears.</p>
				<p>The gaze hath hurt me. It hath taken their rest</p>
				<p>And natural joy from body and spirit, and worn</p>
				<p>Too fast the wheel-work of this frail machine.</p>
				<p>And now, oh! sleeping Nature! while the stars</p>
				<p>Smile on thy face, and I in fancy hear</p>
				<p>The low pulsations of thy dormant life,</p>
				<p>And feel thy mighty bosom heave and fall</p>
				<p>With regular breathings; through <em>my</em> little world</p>
				<p>I feel Disease advancing on his sure</p>
				<p>And stealthy mission. Well I know his step,</p>
				<p>The wily traitor! when I mark my short,</p>
				<p>Quick respirations; and his call I know,</p>
				<p>As, in the hush of night, my ear alarmed</p>
				<p>By the heart&#8217;s death-march notes, repeats its strange</p>
				<p>And audible beatings.</p>
				<p class="i20">Down! grim spectre, down!</p>
				<p>Flap not thy wings across my face, nor let</p>
				<p>Thy ghastly visage, horrible shadow! freeze</p>
				<p>My staring eye-balls! Let me fly, O Death!</p>
				<p>Thy chilling presence, and implore thy soft</p>

				<p>The day-spring reddens: the first few, faint streaks,</p>

				<p>Announce the upward chariot of the Sun.</p>
				<p>Light leaps from Darkness! In the grave of Night</p>
				<p>Day lays aside his burial-robes, and dons</p>
				<p>His regal crown, and Nature smiles to see</p>
				<p>His resurrection, shouting, &#8216;Hail! oh, hail!</p>
				<p>Eve&#8217;s younger<a href="#fn3" class="fnmarker" title="Observe the order of collocation..." id="fnm3" name="fnm3">3</a> brother! and again, all hail!</p>
				<p>Thou bright-eyed Morning! fairest among all</p>
				<p>Of God&#8217;s fair creatures! Rise, bright prince, and shine</p>

				<p>Fanned into motion by thy breezy wings,</p>
				<p>O, fragrant Morning! blows from off the earth</p>
				<p>The congregated vapors, dank and foul,</p>
				<p>By yesterday coagulate and mixed!</p>
				<p>Miasmas steaming up from sunless fens;</p>

				<p>Of her heart&#8217;s chosen.</p>
				<p class="i20">On this climbing hill,</p>

				<p>On the fresh beauties of a world disrobed,</p>

				<p>Inspire the languid frame with new-born life,</p>
				<p>And all its sinking powers rejuvenate,</p>
				<p>Freshening the murky hollows of the soul!</p>
				<p>Good Heaven! How glorious this morning hour,</p>
				<p>Nature&#8217;s new birth-time! All her mighty frame,</p>
				<p>In lowly vale, on lofty mountain-top,</p>
				<p>And wide savannah, stirs, with sprightful life,</p>
				<p>Life irrepressible, whose eager thrill</p>
				<p>Shoots to her very finger-tips, and makes</p>
				<p>Each little flower through all her delicate threads</p>
				<p>Each fibrous plant, each blade of corn or grass,</p>
				<p>And each tall tree, through all its limbs and leaves,</p>
				<p>Quiver and tremble.</p>
				<p class="i20">The increasing light</p>
				<p>Reveals the outlines of the shadowy hills,</p>
				<p>And, charm by charm, the landscape all comes forth,</p>
				<p>Wood, stream, and valley; while above that green</p>
				<p>And waving ocean swells an endless vault</p>
				<p>Of blue serenity, and round its verge</p>
				<p>Kindles and flashes with rubescent gleams</p>
				<p>The far horizon; till the whole appears</p>
				<p>A sapphire dome, which, edged with golden rim,</p>
				<p>Spans the green surges of an emerald sea.</p>
				<p>The Sun is still unseen; yet far before</p>
				<p>His chariot-wheels a train of glory marks</p>
				<p>His kindling track, and all the air is now</p>
				<p>A luminous ocean. Whence these floods of light,</p>
				<p>Rich with all hues? Say! have the spheréd stars,</p>
				<p>Powdered in shining atoms, fallen and filled</p>
				<p>The ambient air with their invisible dews?</p>
				<p>Or have the fugitive particles of light,</p>
				<p>The Sun&#8217;s lost emanations, which all night</p>
				<p>Lay hid in hollows of the earth, or slept</p>
				<p>In vegetable cells, come forth to greet</p>
				<p>Their monarch&#8217;s coming? Are they pioneers</p>
				<p>Sent to prepare his way, and raise his bright</p>
				<p>Victorious banner, that their sovereign&#8217;s eye</p>
				<p>From his serene pavilion may behold</p>
				<p>No lingering shadow from the gloomy host</p>

		<h2 class="title">THE LEGEND OF DON RODERICK.<a href="#fn6" class="fnmarker" title="See 'Editor's Table' of the present number." id="fnm6" name="fnm6">6</a></h2>

		<h3 class="byline">BY THE AUTHOR OF THE SKETCH BOOK.</h3>

		<p><span class="first_word">When</span> in the year of Redemption 701, <span class="special_name">Witizia</span> was elected to the
		Gothic throne, his reign gave promise of happy days to Spain. He redressed
		grievances, moderated the tributes of his subjects, and conducted
		himself with mingled mildness and energy in the administration of
		the laws. In a little while, however, he threw off the mask and showed
		himself in his true nature, cruel and luxurious. Considering himself
		secure upon the throne, he gave the reins to his licentious passions, and
		soon by his tyranny and sensuality acquired the appellation of <span class="special_name">Witizia</span>
		the Wicked. How rare is it to learn wisdom from the misfortunes of
		others! With the fate of <span class="special_name">Witizia</span> full before his eyes, <span class="special_name">Don Roderick</span>
		was no sooner established as his successor, than he began to indulge in
		the same pernicious errors, and was doomed in like manner to prepare
		the way for his own perdition.</p>

		<p>As yet the heart of Roderick, occupied by the struggles of his early
		life, by warlike enterprises, and by the inquietudes of newly-gotten
		power, had been insensible to the charms of women; but in the first
		voluptuous calm the amorous propensities of his nature assumed their
		sway. There are divers accounts of the youthful beauty who first
		found favor in his eyes, and was elevated by him to the throne. We
		follow, in our legend, the details of an Arabian chronicler, authenticated
		by a Spanish poet. Let those who dispute our facts produce better authority
		for their contradiction.</p>

		<p>Among the few fortified places that had not been dismantled by Don
		Roderick was the ancient city of Denia, situated on the Mediterranean
		coast, and defended on a rock-built castle that overlooked the sea.</p>

		<p>The Alcayde of the castle, with many of the people of Denia, was
		one day on his knees in the chapel, imploring the Virgin to allay a
		tempest which was strewing the coast with wrecks, when a sentinel
		brought word that a Moorish cruiser was standing for the land. The
		Alcayde gave orders to ring the alarm bells, light signal-fires on the hill
		tops, and rouse the country; for the coast was subject to cruel maraudings
		from the Barbary cruisers.</p>

		<p>In a little while the horsemen of the neighborhood were seen pricking
		along the beach, armed with such weapons as they could find; and the
		Alcayde and his scanty garrison descended from the hill. In the meantime
		the Moorish bark came rolling and pitching toward the land. As
		it drew near, the rich carving and gilding with which it was decorated,
		its silken bandaroles, and banks of crimson oars, showed it to be no warlike
		vessel, but a sumptuous galleot, destined for state and ceremony.
		It bore the marks of the tempest: the masts were broken, the oars shattered,
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263"></a>263</span>and fragments of snowy sails and silken awnings were fluttering
		in the blast.</p>

		<p>As the galleot grounded upon the sand, the impatient rabble rushed
		into the surf to capture and make spoil; but were awed into admiration
		and respect by the appearance of the illustrious company on board.
		There were Moors of both sexes sumptuously arrayed, and adorned with
		precious jewels, bearing the demeanor of persons of lofty rank. Among
		them shone conspicuous a youthful beauty, magnificently attired, to
		whom all seemed to pay reverence.</p>

		<p>Several of the Moors surrounded her with drawn swords, threatening
		death to any that approached; others sprang from the bark, and, throwing
		themselves on their knees before the Alcayde, implored him, by his
		honor and courtesy as a knight, to protect a royal virgin from injury
		and insult.</p>

		<p>&#8216;You behold before you,&#8217; said they, &#8216;the only daughter of the King of
		Algiers, the betrothed bride of the son of the King of Tunis. We were
		conducting her to the court of her expecting bridegroom, when a tempest
		drove us from our course, and compelled us to take refuge on your
		coast. Be not more cruel than the tempest, but deal nobly with that
		which even sea and storm have spared.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The Alcayde listened to their prayers. He conducted the princess
		and her train to the castle, where every honor due to her rank was paid
		her. Some of her ancient attendants interceded for her liberation, promising
		countless sums to be paid by her father for her ransom; but the
		Alcayde turned a deaf ear to all their golden offers. &#8216;She is a royal
		captive,&#8217; said he; &#8216;it belongs to my sovereign alone to dispose of her.&#8217;
		After she had reposed, therefore, for some days at the castle, and recovered
		from the fatigue and terror of the seas, he caused her to be conducted,
		with all her train, in magnificent state to the court of Don Roderick.</p>

		<p>The beautiful Elyata entered Toledo more like a triumphant sovereign
		than a captive. A chosen band of Christian horsemen, splendidly
		armed, appeared to wait upon her as a mere guard of honor. She was
		surrounded by the Moorish damsels of her train, and followed by her
		own Moslem guards, all attired with the magnificence that had been intended
		to grace her arrival at the court of Tunis. The princess was
		arrayed in bridal robes, woven in the most costly looms of the orient;
		her diadem sparkled with diamonds, and was decorated with the rarest
		plumes of the bird of paradise; and even the silken trappings of her
		palfrey, which swept the ground, were covered with pearls and precious
		stones. As this brilliant cavalcade crossed the bridge of the Tagus,
		all Toledo poured forth to behold it; and nothing was heard throughout
		the city but praises of the wonderful beauty of the princess of Algiers.
		King Roderick came forth attended by the chivalry of his court, to receive
		the royal captive. His recent voluptuous life had disposed him
		for tender and amorous affections, and, at the first sight of the beautiful
		Elyata, he was enraptured with her charms. Seeing her face clouded
		with sorrow and anxiety, he soothed her with gentle and courteous
		words, and, conducting her to a royal palace, &#8216;Behold,&#8217; said he, &#8216;thy
		habitation where no one shall molest thee; consider thyself at home in
		the mansion of thy father, and dispose of any thing according to thy
		will.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>264</span>Here the princess passed her time, with the female attendants who
		had accompanied her from Algiers; and no one but the king was permitted
		to visit her, who daily became more and more enamoured of his
		lovely captive, and sought, by tender assiduity, to gain her affections.
		The distress of the princess at her captivity was soothed by this gentle
		treatment. She was of an age when sorrow cannot long hold sway over
		the heart. Accompanied by her youthful attendants, she ranged the
		spacious apartments of the palace, and sported among the groves and
		alleys of its garden. Every day the remembrance of the paternal
		home grew less and less painful, and the king became more and more
		amiable in her eyes; and when, at length, he offered to share his heart
		and throne with her, she listened with downcast looks and kindling
		blushes, but with an air of resignation.</p>

		<p>One obstacle remained to the complete fruition of the monarch&#8217;s
		wishes, and this was the religion of the princess. Roderick forthwith
		employed the Archbishop of Toledo to instruct the beautiful Elyata in
		the mysteries of the Christian faith. The female intellect is quick in
		perceiving the merits of new doctrines: the archbishop, therefore, soon
		succeeded in converting, not merely the princess, but most of her attendants;
		and a day was appointed for their public baptism. The ceremony
		was performed with great pomp and solemnity, in the presence of
		all the nobility and chivalry of the court. The princess and her damsels,
		clad in white, walked on foot to the cathedral, while numerous
		beautiful children, arrayed as angels, strewed the path with flowers;
		and the archbishop, meeting them at the portal, received them, as it
		were, into the bosom of the church. The princess abandoned her Moorish
		appellation of Elyata, and was baptised by the name of Exilona, by
		which she was thenceforth called, and has generally been known in
		history.</p>

		<p>The nuptials of Roderick and the beautiful convert took place shortly
		afterward, and were celebrated with great magnificence. There were
		jousts, and tourneys, and banquets, and other rejoicings, which lasted
		twenty days, and were attended by the principle nobles from all parts
		of Spain. After these were over, such of the attendants of the princess
		as refused to embrace Christianity, and desired to return to Africa, were
		dismissed with munificent presents; and an embassy was sent to the
		King of Algiers, to inform him of the nuptials of his daughter, and to
		proffer him the friendship of King Roderick.</p>

		<p>For a time Don Roderick lived happily with his young and beautiful
		queen, and Toledo was the seat of festivity and splendor. The principal
		nobles throughout the kingdom repaired to his court to pay him
		homage, and to receive his commands; and none were more devoted in
		their reverence than those who were obnoxious to suspicion, from their
		connection with the late king.</p>

		<p>Among the foremost of these was Count Julian, a man destined to be
		infamously renowned in the dark story of his country&#8217;s woes. He was
		of one of the proudest Gothic families, lord of Consuegra and Algeziras,
		and connected by marriage with Witizia and the Bishop Oppas; his wife,
		the Countess Frandina, being their sister. In consequence of this connection,
		and of his own merits, he had enjoyed the highest dignities and
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>265</span>commands: being one of the Espatorios, or royal sword-bearers; an
		office of the greatest confidence about the person of the sovereign. He
		had, moreover, been intrusted with the military government of the
		Spanish possessions on the African coast of the strait, which at that time
		were threatened by the Arabs of the East, the followers of Mahomet,
		who were advancing their victorious standard to the extremity of Western
		Africa. Count Julian established his seat of government at Ceuta,
		the frontier bulwark, and one of the far-famed gates of the Mediterranean
		Sea. Here he boldly faced, and held in check, the torrent of Moslem
		invasion.</p>

		<p>Don Julian was a man of an active, but irregular genius, and a
		grasping ambition; he had a love for power and grandeur, in which he
		was joined by his haughty countess; and they could ill brook the downfall
		of their house as threatened by the fate of Witizia. They had hastened,
		therefore, to pay their court to the newly elevated monarch, and
		to assure him of their fidelity to his interests.</p>

		<p>Roderick was readily persuaded of the sincerity of Count Julian; he
		was aware of his merits as a soldier and a governor, and continued him
		in his important command; honoring him with many other marks of
		implicit confidence. Count Julian sought to confirm this confidence by
		every proof of devotion. It was a custom among the Goths to rear
		many of the children of the most illustrious families in the royal household.
		They served as pages to the king, and handmaids and ladies of
		honor to the queen, and were instructed in all manner of accomplishments
		befitting their gentle blood. When about to depart for Ceuta, to
		resume his command, Don Julian brought his daughter Florinda to present
		her to the sovereigns. She was a beautiful virgin, that had not as
		yet attained to womanhood. &#8216;I confide her to your protection,&#8217; said he
		to the king, &#8216;to be unto her as a father; and to have her trained in the
		paths of virtue. I can leave with you no dearer pledge of my loyalty.&#8217;</p>

		<p>King Roderick received the timid and blushing maiden into his paternal
		care; promising to watch over her happiness with a parent&#8217;s eye,
		and that she should be enrolled among the most cherished attendants of
		the queen. With this assurance of the welfare of his child, Count Julian
		departed, well pleased, for his government at Ceuta.</p>

		<p>The beautiful daughter of Count Julian was received with great favor
		by the queen Exilona, and admitted among the noble damsels that attended
		upon her person. Here she lived in honor and apparent security,
		and surrounded by innocent delights. To gratify his queen, Don Roderick
		had built for her rural recreation, a palace without the walls of
		Toledo, on the banks of the Tagus. It stood in the midst of a garden,
		adorned after the luxurious style of the east. The air was perfumed
		by fragrant shrubs and flowers; the groves resounded with the song of
		the nightingale; while the gush of fountains and waterfalls, and the
		distant murmur of the Tagus, made it a delightful retreat during the
		sultry days of summer. The charm of perfect privacy also reigned
		throughout the place; for the garden walls were high, and numerous
		guards kept watch without to protect it from all intrusion.</p>

		<p>In this delicious abode, more befitting an oriental voluptuary than a
		Gothic king, Don Roderick was accustomed to while away much of that
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>266</span>time which should have been devoted to the toilsome cares of government.
		The very security and peace which he had produced throughout
		his dominions, by his precautions to abolish the means and habitudes
		of war, had effected a disastrous change in his character. The hardy
		and heroic qualities which had conducted him to the throne, were softened
		in the lap of indulgence. Surrounded by the pleasures of an idle
		and effeminate court, and beguiled by the example of his degenerate
		nobles, he gave way to a fatal sensuality that had lain dormant in his
		nature during the virtuous days of his adversity. The mere love of
		female beauty had first enamoured him of Exilona; and the same passion,
		fostered by voluptuous idleness, now betrayed him into the commission
		of an act fatal to himself and Spain. The following is the story
		of his error, as gathered from an old chronicle and legend.</p>

		<p>In a remote part of the palace was an apartment devoted to the queen.
		It was like an eastern harem, shut up from the foot of man, and where
		the king himself but rarely entered. It had its own courts, and gardens,
		and fountains, where the queen was wont to recreate herself with
		her damsels, as she had been accustomed to do in the jealous privacy of
		her father&#8217;s palace.</p>

		<p>One sultry day, the king, instead of taking his siesta, or mid-day
		slumber, repaired to this apartment to seek the society of the queen.
		In passing through a small oratory, he was drawn by the sound of female
		voices to a casement overhung with myrtles and jessamines. It looked
		into an interior garden, or court, set out with orange trees, in the midst
		of which was a marble fountain, surrounded by a grassy bank, enamelled
		with flowers.</p>

		<p>It was the high noontide of a summer day, when, in sultry Spain, the
		landscape trembles to the eye, and all nature seeks repose, except the
		grasshopper, that pipes his lulling note to the herdsman as he sleeps beneath
		the shade.</p>

		<p>Around the fountain were several of the damsels of the queen, who,
		confident of the sacred privacy of the place, were yielding in that cool
		retreat to the indulgence prompted by the season and the hour. Some
		lay asleep on the flowery bank; others sat on the margin of the fountain,
		talking and laughing, as they bathed their feet in its limpid waters,
		and King Roderick beheld delicate limbs shining through the wave, that
		might rival the marble in whiteness.</p>

		<p>Among the damsels was one who had come from the Barbary coast
		with the queen. Her complexion had the dark tinge of Mauritania,
		but it was clear and transparent, and the deep rich rose blushed through
		the lovely brown. Her eyes were black and full of fire, and flashed
		from under long silken eye-lashes.</p>

		<p>A sportive contest arose among the maidens, as to the comparative
		beauty of the Spanish and Moorish forms; but the Mauritanian damsel
		revealed limbs of voluptuous symmetry that seemed to defy all rivalry.</p>

		<p>The Spanish beauties were on the point of giving up the contest,
		when they bethought themselves of the young Florinda, the daughter of
		Count Julian, who lay on the grassy bank, abandoned to a summer slumber.
		The soft glow of youth and health mantled on her cheek; her
		fringed eyelashes scarcely covered their sleeping orbs; her moist and
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>267</span>ruby lips were lightly parted, just revealing a gleam of her ivory teeth;
		while her innocent bosom rose and fell beneath her bodice, like the gentle
		swelling and sinking of a tranquil sea. There was a breathing tenderness
		and beauty in the sleeping virgin, that seemed to send forth
		sweetness like the flowers around her.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Behold,&#8217; cried her companions exultingly, &#8216;the champion of Spanish
		beauty!&#8217;</p>

		<p>In their playful eagerness they half disrobed the innocent Florinda
		before she was aware. She awoke in time, however, to escape from
		their busy hands; but enough of her charms had been revealed to convince
		the monarch that they were not to be rivalled by the rarest beauties
		of Mauritania.</p>

		<p>From this day the heart of Roderick was inflamed with a fatal passion.
		He gazed on the beautiful Florinda with fervid desire, and sought
		to read in her looks whether there was levity or wantonness in her
		bosom; but the eye of the damsel ever sunk beneath his gaze, and remained
		bent on the earth in virgin modesty.</p>

		<p>It was in vain he called to mind the sacred trust reposed in him by
		Count Julian, and the promise he had given to watch over his daughter
		with paternal care; his heart was vitiated by sensual indulgence, and
		the consciousness of power had rendered him selfish in his gratifications.</p>

		<p>Being one evening in the garden where the queen was diverting herself
		with her damsels, and coming to the fountain where he had beheld
		the innocent maidens at their sport, he could no longer restrain the passion
		that raged within his breast. Seating himself beside the fountain,
		he called Florinda to him to draw forth a thorn which had pierced his
		hand. The maiden knelt at his feet to examine his hand, and the touch
		of her slender fingers thrilled through his veins. As she knelt, too, her
		amber locks fell in rich ringlets about her beautiful head, her innocent
		bosom palpitated beneath the crimson boddice, and her timid blushes
		increased the effulgence of her charms.</p>

		<p>Having examined the monarch&#8217;s hand in vain, she looked up in his
		face with artless perplexity.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Senior,&#8217; said she, &#8216;I can find no thorn, nor any sign of wound.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Don Roderick grasped her hand and pressed it to his heart. &#8216;It is
		here, lovely Florinda!&#8217; said he, &#8216;It is here! and thou alone canst pluck
		it forth!&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;My lord!&#8217; exclaimed the blushing and astonished maiden.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Florinda!&#8217; said Don Roderick, &#8216;dost thou love me?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Senior,&#8217; said she, &#8216;my father taught me to love and reverence you.
		He confided me to your care as one who would be as a parent to me,
		when he should be far distant, serving your majesty with life and loyalty.
		May God incline your majesty ever to protect me as a father.&#8217;
		So saying, the maiden dropped her eyes to the ground, and continued
		kneeling; but her countenance had become deadly pale, and as she
		knelt she trembled.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Florinda,&#8217; said the king, &#8216;either thou dost not or thou wilt not understand
		me. I would have thee love me, not as a father, nor as a monarch,
		but as one who adores thee. Why dost thou start? No one shall
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>268</span>know our loves; and, moreover, the love of a monarch inflicts no degradation
		like the love of a common man; riches and honors attend upon
		it. I will advance thee to rank and dignity, and place thee above the
		proudest females of my court. Thy father, too, shall be more exalted
		and endowed than any noble in my realm.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The soft eye of Florinda kindled at these words. &#8216;Senior,&#8217; said she,
		&#8216;the line I spring from can receive no dignity by means so vile; and
		my father would rather die than purchase rank and power by the dishonor
		of his child. But I see,&#8217; continued she, &#8216;that your majesty
		speaks in this manner only to try me. You may have thought me light
		and simple and unworthy to attend upon the queen. I pray your majesty
		to pardon me, that I have taken your pleasantry in such serious part.&#8217;</p>

		<p>In this way the agitated maiden sought to evade the addresses of the
		monarch; but still her cheek was blanched, and her lip quivered as she
		spake.</p>

		<p>The king pressed her hand to his lips with fervor. &#8216;May ruin seize
		me,&#8217; cried he, &#8216;if I speak to prove thee! My heart, my kingdom, are
		at thy command. Only be mine, and thou shalt rule absolute mistress
		of myself and my domains.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The damsel rose from the earth where she had hitherto knelt, and her
		whole countenance glowed with virtuous indignation. &#8216;My Lord,&#8217; said
		she, &#8216;I am your subject, and in your power; take my life if it be your
		pleasure; but nothing shall tempt me to commit a crime which would
		be treason to the queen, disgrace to my father, agony to my mother, and
		perdition to myself.&#8217; With these words she left the garden, and the
		king, for the moment, was too much awed by her indignant virtue to
		oppose her departure.</p>

		<p>We shall pass briefly over the succeeding events of the story of
		Florinda, about which so much has been said and sung by chronicler
		and bard: for the sober page of history should be carefully chastened
		from all scenes that might inflame a wanton imagination; leaving them
		to poems and romances, and such-like highly seasoned works of fantasy
		and recreation.</p>

		<p>Let it suffice to say, that Don Roderick pursued his suit to the beautiful
		Florinda, his passion being more and more inflamed by the resistance
		of the virtuous damsel. At length, forgetting what was due to
		helpless beauty, to his own honor as a knight, and his word as a sovereign,
		he triumphed over her weakness by base and unmanly violence.</p>

		<p>There are not wanting those who affirm that the hapless Florinda lent
		a yielding ear to the solicitations of the monarch, and her name has
		been treated with opprobrium in several of the ancient chronicles and
		legendary ballads that have transmitted, from generation to generation,
		the story of the woes of Spain. In very truth, however, she appears to
		have been a guiltless victim, resisting, as far as helpless female could
		resist, the arts and intrigues of a powerful monarch, who had nought to
		check the indulgence of his will, and bewailing her disgrace with a
		poignancy that shows how dearly she had prized her honor.</p>

		<p>In the first paroxysm of her grief she wrote a letter to her father,
		blotted with her tears, and almost incoherent from her agitation.
		&#8216;Would to God, my father,&#8217; said she, &#8216;that the earth had opened and
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269"></a>269</span>swallowed me ere I had been reduced to write these lines! I blush to
		tell thee, what it is not proper to conceal. Alas! my father; thou hast
		entrusted thy lamb to the guardianship of the lion. Thy daughter has
		been dishonored, the royal cradle of the Goths polluted, and our lineage
		insulted and disgraced. Hasten, my father, to rescue your child from
		the power of the spoiler, and to vindicate the honor of your house!&#8217;</p>

		<p>When Florinda had written these lines, she summoned a youthful
		esquire, who had been a page in the service of her father. &#8216;Saddle
		thy steed,&#8217; said she, &#8216;and if thou dost aspire to knightly honor, or hope
		for lady&#8217;s grace&#8212;if thou hast fealty for thy lord, or devotion to his
		daughter&#8212;speed swiftly upon my errand. Rest not, halt not, spare
		not the spur; but hie thee day and night until thou reach the sea; take
		the first bark, and haste with sail and oar to Ceuta, nor pause until thou
		give this letter to the count my father.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The youth put the letter in his bosom. &#8216;Trust me, lady,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I
		will neither halt nor turn aside, nor cast a look behind, until I reach
		Count Julian.&#8217; He mounted his fleet steed, sped his way across the
		bridge, and soon left behind him the verdant valley of the Tagus.</p>

		<p class="post_break">The heart of Don Roderick was not so depraved by sensuality, but
		that the wrong he had been guilty of toward the innocent Florinda,
		and the disgrace he had inflicted on her house, weighed heavy on his
		spirits, and a cloud began to gather on his once clear and unwrinkled
		brow.</p>

		<p>Heaven, at this time, say the old Spanish chronicles, permitted a
		marvellous intimation of the wrath with which it intended to visit the
		monarch and his people, in punishment of their sins; nor are we, say
		the same orthodox writers, to startle, and withhold our faith, when we
		meet in the page of discreet and sober history with these signs and
		portents, which transcend the probabilities of ordinary life; for the
		revolutions of empires and the downfall of mighty kings are awful
		events, that shake the physical as well as the moral world, and are
		often announced by forerunning marvels and prodigious omens. With
		such-like cautious preliminaries do the wary but credulous historiographers
		of yore usher in a marvellous event of prophecy and enchantment,
		linked in ancient story with the fortunes of Don Roderick, but
		which modern doubters would fain hold up as an apocryphal tradition
		of Arabian origin.</p>

		<p>Now, so it happened, according to the legend, that about this time, as
		King Roderick was seated one day on his throne, surrounded by his
		nobles, in the ancient city of Toledo, two men of venerable appearance
		entered the hall of audience. Their snowy beards descended to their
		breasts, and their gray hairs were bound with ivy. They were arrayed
		in white garments of foreign or antiquated fashion, which swept the
		ground, and were cinctured with girdles, wrought with the signs of the
		zodiac, from which were suspended enormous bunches of keys of every
		variety of form. Having approached the throne and made obeisance:
		&#8216;Know, O King,&#8217; said one of the old men, &#8216;that in days of yore, when
		Hercules of Libya, surnamed the strong, had set up his pillars at the
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>270</span>ocean strait, he erected a tower near to this ancient city of Toledo.
		He built it of prodigious strength, and finished it with magic art, shutting
		up within it a fearful secret, never to be penetrated without peril
		and disaster. To protect this terrible mystery he closed the entrance to
		the edifice with a ponderous door of iron, secured by a great lock of
		steel; and he left a command that every king who should succeed him
		should add another lock to the portal; denouncing wo and destruction
		on him who should eventually unfold the secret of the tower.</p>

		<p>&#8216;The guardianship of the portal was given to our ancestors, and has
		continued in our family, from generation to generation, since the days
		of Hercules. Several kings, from time to time, have caused the gate
		to be thrown open, and have attempted to enter, but have paid dearly
		for their temerity. Some have perished within the threshold, others
		have been overwhelmed with horror at tremendous sounds, which shook
		the foundations of the earth, and have hastened to re-close the door, and
		secure it with its thousand locks. Thus, since the days of Hercules,
		the inmost recesses of the pile have never been penetrated by mortal
		man, and a profound mystery continues to prevail over this great
		enchantment. This, O King, is all we have to relate; and our errand
		is to entreat thee to repair to the tower and affix thy lock to the portal,
		as has been done by all thy predecessors.&#8217; Having thus said, the
		ancient men made a profound reverence and departed from the presence
		chamber.</p>

		<p>Don Roderick remained for some time lost in thought after the departure
		of the men: he then dismissed all his court, excepting the venerable
		Urbino, at that time archbishop of Toledo. The long white beard of
		this prelate bespoke his advanced age, and his overhanging eye-brows
		showed him a man full of wary counsel.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Father,&#8217; said the king, &#8216;I have an earnest desire to penetrate the
		mystery of this tower.&#8217; The worthy prelate shook his hoary head:
		&#8216;Beware, my son,&#8217; said he; &#8216;there are secrets hidden from man for his
		good. Your predecessors for many generations have respected this
		mystery, and have increased in might and empire. A knowledge of it,
		therefore, is not material to the welfare of your kingdom. Seek not
		then to indulge a rash and unprofitable curiosity, which is interdicted
		under such awful menaces.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Of what importance,&#8217; cried the king, &#8216;are the menaces of Hercules,
		the Lybian? Was he not a pagan? and can his enchantments have
		aught avail against a believer in our holy faith? Doubtless, in this
		tower are locked up treasures of gold and jewels, amassed in days of
		old, the spoils of mighty kings, the riches of the pagan world. My
		coffers are exhausted; I have need of supply; and surely it would be
		an acceptable act in the eyes of Heaven, to draw forth this wealth
		which lies buried under profane and necromantic spells, and consecrate
		it to religious purposes.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The venerable archbishop still continued to remonstrate, but Don
		Roderick heeded not his counsel, for he was led on by his malignant
		star. &#8216;Father,&#8217; said he, &#8216;it is in vain you attempt to dissuade me.
		My resolution is fixed. To-morrow I will explore the hidden mystery,
		or rather the hidden treasures of this tower.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>271</span>The morning sun shone brightly upon the cliff-built towers of Toledo,
		when King Roderick issued out of the gate of the city, at the head of
		a numerous train of courtiers and cavaliers, and crossed the bridge that
		bestrides the deep rocky bed of the Tagus. The shining cavalcade
		wound up the road that leads among the mountains, and soon came in
		sight of the necromantic tower.</p>

		<p>Of this renowned edifice marvels are related by the ancient Arabian
		and Spanish chroniclers; &#8216;and I doubt much,&#8217; adds the venerable
		Agpaida, &#8216;whether many readers will not consider the whole as a
		cunningly devised fable, sprung from an oriental imagination; but it is
		not for me to reject a fact which is recorded by all those writers who
		are the fathers of our national history: a fact, too, which is as well
		attested as most of the remarkable events in the story of Don Roderick.
		None but light and inconsiderate minds,&#8217; continues the good friar, &#8216;do
		hastily reject the marvellous. To the thinking mind the whole world
		is enveloped in mystery, and every thing is full of type and portent.
		To such a mind the necromantic tower of Toledo will appear as one of
		those wondrous monuments of the olden time; one of those Egyptian
		and Chaldaic piles, storied with hidden wisdom and mystic prophecy,
		which have been devised in past ages, when man yet enjoyed an intercourse
		with high and spiritual natures, and when human foresight partook
		of divination.&#8217;</p>

		<p>This singular tower was round, and of great height and grandeur;
		erected upon a lofty rock, and surrounded by crags and precipices.
		The foundation was supported by four brazen lions, each taller than a
		cavalier on horseback. The walls were built of small pieces of jasper,
		and various colored marbles, not larger than a man&#8217;s hand; so subtilely
		joined, however, that but for their different hues they might be taken
		for one entire stone. They were arranged with marvellous cunning,
		so as to represent battles and warlike deeds of times and heroes long
		since passed away; and the whole surface was so admirably polished
		that the stones were as lustrous as glass, and reflected the rays of the
		sun with such resplendent brightness as to dazzle all beholders.<a href="#fn7" class="fnmarker" title="From the minute account of the good friar..." id="fnm7" name="fnm7">7</a></p>

		<p>King Roderick and his courtiers arrived wondering and amazed, at
		the foot of the rock. Here there was a narrow arched way cut through
		the living stone; the only entrance to the tower. It was closed by a
		massive iron gate, covered with rusty locks of divers workmanship,
		and in the fashion of different centuries, which had been affixed by the
		predecessors of Don Roderick. On either side of the portal stood the
		two ancient guardians of the tower, laden with the keys appertaining
		to the locks.</p>

		<p>The king alighted, and, approaching the portals, ordered the guardians
		to unlock the gate. The hoary-headed men drew back with terror.
		&#8216;Alas!&#8217; cried they, &#8216;what is it your majesty requires of us? Would
		you have the mischiefs of this tower unbound, and let loose to shake the
		earth to its foundations?&#8217;</p>

		<p>The venerable archbishop Urbino likewise implored him not to disturb
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272"></a>272</span>a mystery which had been held sacred from generation to generation,
		within the memory of man; and which even Cæsar himself,
		when sovereign of Spain, had not ventured to invade. The youthful
		cavaliers, however, were eager to pursue the adventure, and encouraged
		him in his rash curiosity.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Come what come may,&#8217; exclaimed Don Roderick, &#8216;I am resolved to
		penetrate the mystery of this tower.&#8217; So saying, he again commanded
		the guardians to unlock the portal. The ancient men obeyed with fear
		and trembling, but their hands shook with age, and when they applied
		the keys, the locks were so rusted by time, or of such strange workmanship,
		that they resisted their feeble efforts; whereupon the young
		cavaliers pressed forward and lent their aid. Still the locks were so
		numerous and difficult, that with all their eagerness and strength a great
		part of the day was exhausted before the whole of them could be mastered.</p>

		<p>When the last bolt had yielded to the key, the guardians and the
		reverend archbishop again entreated the king to pause and reflect.
		&#8216;Whatever is within this tower,&#8217; said they, &#8216;is as yet harmless, and
		lies bound under a mighty spell: venture not then to open a door which
		may let forth a flood of evil upon the land.&#8217; But the anger of the king
		was roused, and he ordered that the portal should be instantly thrown
		open. In vain, however, did one after another exert his strength; and
		equally in vain did the cavaliers unite their forces, and apply their
		shoulders to the gate: though there was neither bar nor bolt remaining,
		it was perfectly immoveable.</p>

		<p>The patience of the king was now exhausted, and he advanced to
		apply his hand; scarcely, however, did he touch the iron gate, when it
		swung slowly open, uttering, as it were, a dismal groan, as it turned
		reluctantly upon its hinges. A cold, damp wind issued forth, accompanied
		by a tempestuous sound. The hearts of the ancient guardians
		quaked within them, and their knees smote together; but several of
		the youthful cavaliers rushed in, eager to gratify their curiosity, or to
		signalise themselves in this redoubtable enterprise. They had scarcely
		advanced a few paces, however, when they recoiled, overcome by the
		baleful air, or by some fearful vision. Upon this, the king ordered that
		fires should be kindled to dispel the darkness, and to correct the noxious
		and long imprisoned air: he then led the way into the interior; but,
		though stout of heart, he advanced with awe and hesitation.</p>

		<p>After proceeding a short distance, he entered a hall, or antechamber,
		on the opposite side of which was a door; and before it, on a
		pedestal, stood a gigantic figure, of the color of bronze, and of a terrible
		aspect. It held a huge mace, which it whirled incessantly, giving such
		cruel and resounding blows upon the earth as to prevent all further
		entrance.</p>

		<p>The king paused at sight of this appalling figure; for whether it
		were a living being, or a statue of magic artifice, he could not tell. On
		its breast was a scroll, whereon was inscribed in large letters, &#8216;I do
		my duty.&#8217; After a little while Roderick plucked up heart, and addressed
		it with great solemnity: &#8216;Whatever thou be,&#8217; said he, &#8216;know
		that I come not to violate this sanctuary, but to inquire into the mystery
		it contains; I conjure thee, therefore, to let me pass in safety.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>273</span>Upon this the figure paused with uplifted mace, and the king and his
		train passed unmolested through the door.</p>

		<p>They now entered a vast chamber, of a rare and sumptuous architecture,
		difficult to be described. The walls were incrusted with the
		most precious gems, so joined together as to form one smooth and perfect
		surface. The lofty dome appeared to be self-supported, and was studded
		with gems, lustrous as the stars of the firmament. There was
		neither wood, nor any other common or base material to be seen
		throughout the edifice. There were no windows or rather openings to
		admit the day, yet a radiant light was spread throughout the place,
		which seemed to shine from the walls, and to render every object distinctly
		visible.</p>

		<p>In the centre of this hall stood a table of alabaster, of the rarest
		workmanship, on which was inscribed in Greek characters, that Hercules
		Alcides, the Theban Greek, had founded this tower in the year
		of the world three thousand and six. Upon the table stood a golden
		casket, richly set round with precious stones, and closed with a lock of
		mother-of-pearl; and on the lid were inscribed the following words:</p>

		<p>&#8216;In this coffer is contained the mystery of the tower. The hand of
		none but a king can open it; but let him beware! for marvellous events
		will be revealed to him, which are to take place before his death.&#8217;</p>

		<p>King Roderick boldly seized upon the casket. The venerable archbishop
		laid his hand upon his arm, and made a last remonstrance.
		&#8216;Forbear, my son!&#8217; said he; &#8216;desist while there is yet time. Look not
		into the mysterious decrees of Providence. God has hidden them in
		mercy from our sight, and it is impious to rend the veil by which they
		are concealed.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;What have I to dread from a knowledge of the future?&#8217; replied
		Roderick, with an air of haughty presumption. &#8216;If good be destined
		me, I shall enjoy it by anticipation: if evil, I shall arm myself to meet
		it.&#8217; So saying, he rashly broke the lock.</p>

		<p>Within the coffer he found nothing but a linen cloth, folded between
		two tablets of copper. On unfolding it, he beheld painted on it figures
		of men on horseback, of fierce demeanor, clad in turbans and robes of
		various colors, after the fashion of the Arabs, with scimetars hanging
		from their necks, and cross-bows at their saddle backs, and they carried
		banners and pennons with divers devices. Above them was inscribed
		in Greek characters, &#8216;Rash monarch! behold the men who are to hurl
		thee from thy throne, and subdue thy kingdom!&#8217;</p>

		<p>At sight of these things the king was troubled in spirit, and dismay
		fell upon his attendants. While they were yet regarding the paintings,
		it seemed as if the figures began to move, and a faint sound of warlike
		tumult arose from the cloth, with the clash of cymbal and bray of
		trumpet, the neigh of steed and shout of army; but all was heard
		indistinctly, as if afar off, or in a reverie or dream. The more they
		gazed, the plainer became the motion, and the louder the noise; and
		the linen cloth rolled forth, and amplified and spread out, as it were, a
		mighty banner, and filled the hall, and mingled with the air, until its
		texture was no longer visible, or appeared as a transparent cloud: and
		the shadowy figures become all in motion, and the din and uproar
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>274</span>became fiercer and fiercer; and whether the whole were an animated
		picture, or a vision, or an array of embodied spirits, conjured up by
		supernatural power, no one present could tell. They beheld before
		them a great field of battle, where Christians and Moslems were
		engaged in deadly conflict. They heard the rush and tramp of steeds,
		the blast of trump and clarion, the clash of cymbal, and the stormy din
		of a thousand drums. There was the clash of swords, and maces, and
		battle-axes, with the whistling of arrows, and the hurling of darts and
		lances. The Christians quailed before the foe; the infidels pressed
		upon them and put them to utter rout; the standard of the cross was
		cast down, the banner of Spain was trodden under foot, the air resounded
		with shouts of triumph, with yells of fury, and with the groans of dying
		men. Amidst the flying squadrons, King Roderick beheld a crowned
		warrior, whose back was turned toward him, but whose armor and
		device were his own, and who was mounted on a white steed that
		resembled his own war horse Orelia. In the confusion of the flight,
		the warrior was dismounted, and was no longer to be seen, and Orelia
		galloped wildly through the field of battle without a rider.</p>

		<p>Roderick stayed to see no more, but rushed from the fatal hall, followed
		by his terrified attendants. They fled through the outer chamber,
		where the gigantic figure with the whirling mace had disappeared
		from his pedestal; and on issuing into the open air, they found the
		two ancient guardians of the tower lying dead at the portal, as though
		they had been crushed by some mighty blow. All nature, which had
		been clear and serene, was now in wild uproar. The heavens were
		darkened by heavy clouds; loud bursts of thunder rent the air, and the
		earth was deluged with rain and rattling hail.</p>

		<p>The king ordered that the iron portal should be closed; but the door
		was immoveable, and the cavaliers were dismayed by the tremendous
		turmoil, and the mingled shouts and groans that continued to prevail
		within. The king and his train hastened back to Toledo, pursued and
		pelted by the tempest. The mountains shook and echoed with the
		thunder, trees were uprooted and blown down, and the Tagus raged
		and roared and flowed above its banks. It seemed to the affrighted
		courtiers as if the phantom legions of the tower had issued forth and
		mingled with the storm; for amidst the claps of thunder and the
		howling of the wind, they fancied they heard the sound of the drums
		and trumpets, the shouts of armies and the rush of steeds. Thus beaten
		by tempest, and overwhelmed with horror, the king and his courtiers
		arrived at Toledo, clattering across the bridge of the Tagus, and entering
		the gate in headlong confusion, as though they had been pursued by an
		enemy.</p>

		<p>In the morning the heavens were again serene, and all nature was
		restored to tranquillity. The king, therefore, issued forth with his
		cavaliers and took the road to the tower, followed by a great multitude,
		for he was anxious once more to close the iron door, and shut up those
		evils that threatened to overwhelm the land. But lo! on coming in
		sight of the tower, a new wonder met their eyes. An eagle appeared
		high in the air, seeming to descend from heaven. He bore in his
		beak a burning brand, and lighting on the summit of the tower, fanned
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>275</span>the fire with his wings. In a little while the edifice burst forth into a
		blaze as though it had been built of rosin, and the flames mounted into
		the air with a brilliancy more dazzling than the sun; nor did they
		cease until every stone was consumed and the whole was reduced to a
		heap of ashes. Then there came a vast flight of birds, small of size
		and sable of hue, darkening the sky like a cloud; and they descended
		and wheeled in circles round the ashes, causing so great a wind with
		their wings that the whole was borne up into the air and scattered
		throughout all Spain, and wherever a particle of those ashes fell it was
		as a stain of blood. It is furthermore recorded by ancient men and
		writers of former days, that all those on whom this dust fell were afterwards
		slain in battle, when the country was conquered by the Arabs,
		and that the destruction of this necromantic tower was a sign and token
		of the approaching perdition of Spain.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Let all those,&#8217; concludes the cautious friar, &#8216;who question the verity
		of this most marvellous occurrence, consult those admirable sources of
		our history, the chronicle of the Moor Rasis, and the work entitled
		&#8216;The Fall of Spain,&#8217; written by the Moor, Abulcasim Tarif Abentarique.
		Let them consult, moreover, the venerable historian Bleda, and the
		cloud of other Catholic Spanish writers, who have treated of this event,
		and they will find I have related nothing that has not been printed and
		published under the inspection and sanction of our holy mother church.
		God alone knoweth the truth of these things; I speak nothing but what
		has been handed down to me from times of old.&#8217;</p>

		<h2 class="title">LITERARY NOTICES.</h2>

		<p class="work_reviewed"><span class="special_name">A Christmas Carol, in Prose</span>: Being a Ghost-Story of Christmas. By <span class="special_name">Charles Dickens</span>.
		New-York: <span class="special_name">Harper and Brothers</span>.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">If</span> in every alternate work that Mr. <span class="special_name">Dickens</span> were to send to the London press he
		should find occasion to indulge in ridicule against alleged American peculiarities, or broad
		caricatures of our actual vanities, or other follies, we could with the utmost cheerfulness
		pass them by unnoted and uncondemned, if he would only now and then present us with
		an intellectual creation so touching and beautiful as the one before us. Indeed, we can
		with truth say, that in our deliberate judgment, the &#8216;Christmas Carol&#8217; is the most striking,
		the most picturesque, the most truthful, of all the limnings which have proceeded from its
		author&#8217;s pen. There is much mirth in the book, says a competent English critic, but more
		wisdom; wisdom of that kind which men possess who have gazed thoughtfully but kindly
		on human life, and have pierced deeper than their fellows into all the sunny nooks and
		dark recesses of the human breast. The barbarous notion has long been exploded, that
		comic writers were only to be esteemed for their jests, and useful for provoking laughter.
		<span class="special_name">Cervantes</span>, first among the moderns, sent it out of fashion, and blessed that union of wit,
		sense, and pathos, which so many renowned writers have since confirmed; until it has
		come to be acknowledged, that rich genuine humor is rarely an inmate of the mind, if
		there be not a corresponding depth of earnestness and feeling in the heart. Many of
		<span class="special_name">Dickens&#8217;</span> writings, it is justly claimed, exhibit this fine, healthy, benevolent spirit. &#8216;His
		sympathy for human suffering is strong and pure, and he reserves it not for imaginary and
		fictitious distress, but for the real grinding sorrows of life.&#8217; And this sympathy is more
		finely displayed in the work under notice, than in any of his previous productions. The
		design is very fanciful, and there is crowded into it, brief as it is, a world of character and
		observation. It is truly a reflection of life in miniature. Before proceeding to a few illustrative
		extracts, we shall avail ourselves in part of a clear synopsis of the inception and
		progress of the story, from the pen of a London contemporary.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Scrooge</span> is a very rich citizen; a &#8216;squeezing, grinding, grasping, scraping, clutching,
		covetous old sinner.&#8217; He has lost all recollection of what he once was, and what he once
		felt; is dead to all kindly impulses, and proof against the most moving tale. He is almost
		as keen and gruff as old <span class="special_name">Ralph Nickelby</span>, to whom he bears a strong family resemblance,
		and uses his poor clerk, <span class="special_name">Bob Cratchit</span>, just as badly, and has as little feeling for his
		merry-hearted nephew, who has married for love. The &#8216;carol&#8217; begins on Christmas-eve.
		<span class="special_name">Scrooge</span> calls his nephew a lunatic for wishing him &#8216;A merry Christmas!&#8217; and sends him
		home, sad as harsh words can make him. He keeps his poor shivering clerk in a small
		tank-like ground-room till the last minute of his stipulated time, and then dismisses him
		with an angry growl. He goes to his usual melancholy tavern to eat his melancholy dinner,
		amuses himself in the evening with his banker&#8217;s book, and then retires to his dreary
		chambers. He had once a partner, a counterpart of himself, who has been dead for many
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>277</span>a year; and while sitting in his lonely room, over a low fire, the ghost of the deceased
		partner enters, although the door is double-locked. He wears a heavy chain, forged of keys
		and safes; and, like Hamlet&#8217;s ghost, tells of the heavy penance he is doomed to suffer in
		spirit for sins committed in the flesh. He has come to warn his partner, and to give him a
		chance of amendment. He tells him he will be visited by three Spirits, on the three following
		nights, and bids him mark well what they shall disclose. <span class="special_name">Scrooge</span> instantly falls
		asleep, and does not wake till the appointed hour. The three spirits are of Christmas Past,
		Christmas Present, and Christmas to Come. The ghost of Christmas Past stands by
		<span class="special_name">Scrooge&#8217;s</span> bedside, of an uncertain form, though the belt round its body is wondrous light,
		and a flame shoots up from its head. Yet the figure fluctuates in distinctness, now one
		part being visible and now another. The spirit seizes the hand of <span class="special_name">Scrooge</span>, and they
		float through the air together. The old man is taken to the haunts of his childhood, and
		he is conscious of &#8216;a thousand odors floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand
		thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long forgotten.&#8217; Each circumstance of the
		time past is restored. The village school; a boy left deserted in the school-room, whom
		<span class="special_name">Scrooge</span> recognises as his former self reading &#8216;Robinson Crusoe;&#8217; till at last a lovely girl,
		who throws her arms round the boy&#8217;s neck, and bids him come home to a &#8216;merry, merry
		Christmas.&#8217; Then the scene changes, and <span class="special_name">Scrooge</span> is once more in the house of the kind-hearted
		master of his youth, who loved to keep Christmas as it was kept in the olden time,
		and he recognises himself the most joyous of the joyous group. Then comes the scene of
		his manhood, when he deserted his betrothed for a wealthier bride; and last, he views the
		girl he had deserted, the mother of a happy blooming family. This picture is delightfully
		sketched; it is enough to make a bachelor in love with wedlock. The scene is too affecting
		for the changed and worldly miser; he implores to be removed from the familiar place;
		he wrestles with the spirit, and awakened by the struggle, finds himself once more in his
		own room, and in darkness.</p>

		<p>Again he has a long sleep. Christmas Present comes in the shape of a giant, with a
		holly-green robe. <span class="special_name">Scrooge</span> perceives him seated in his room, with his noble head crowned
		with holly wreath studded with icicles, reaching to the ceiling. His throne is a wine-cask
		and his foot-stool a twelfth-cake. In his hand he bears a blazing torch, from which he
		sprinkles down gladness upon every threshhold he enters. An immense fire glows and
		crackles in the grate, the walls and ceiling are hung with living green, and all around are
		heaped up the choice provisions collected to make Christmas glad. The giant leads <span class="special_name">Scrooge</span>
		forth. They pass through streets and lanes, with every house bearing token of rejoicing
		by its roaring fire or its sprig of holly, till they come to the dwelling of poor <span class="special_name">Bob Cratchit</span>,
		old <span class="special_name">Scrooge&#8217;s</span> clerk. And here ensues a picture worthy of <span class="special_name">Wilkie</span> in his best days:</p>

		<div class="quotation">
			<p>&#8216;Perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off his power, or else it was his own
			kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge&#8217;s
			clerk&#8217;s; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshhold of
			the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit&#8217;s dwelling with the sprinkling of his
			torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen &#8216;Bob&#8217; a week himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but
			fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed
			house!</p>

			<p>&#8216;Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit&#8217;s wife, dressed out but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but
			brave in ribands, which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted
			by Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribands; while Master Peter
			Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt-collar
			(Bob&#8217;s private property, conferred upon his son and heir in honor of the day) into his mouth,
			rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks.
			And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker&#8217;s they
			had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage-and-onions,
			these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies,
			while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes,
			bubbling up, knocked proudly at the sauce-pan lid to be let out and peeled.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;What has ever got your precious father, then?&#8217; said Mrs. Cratchit. &#8216;And your brother, Tiny
			Tim; and Martha warn&#8217;t as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour!&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;Here&#8217;s Martha, mother!&#8217; said a girl, appearing as she spoke.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;Here&#8217;s Martha, mother!&#8217; cried the two young Cratchits. &#8216;Hurrah! There&#8217;s <i>such</i> a goose,
			Martha!&#8217;</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>278</span>&#8216;&#8216;Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!&#8217; said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen
			times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her, with officious zeal.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;We&#8217;d a deal of work to finish up last night,&#8217; replied the girl, &#8216;and had to clear away this morning,
			mother!&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;Well! Never mind so long as you are come,&#8217; said Mrs. Cratchit. &#8216;Sit ye down before the fire,
			my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;No, no! There&#8217;s father coming,&#8217; cried the two young Cratchits, who were every where at once.
			&#8216;Hide, Martha, hide!&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least three feet of comforter, exclusive
			of the fringe, hanging down before him; and his thread-bare clothes darned up and brushed, to
			look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and
			had his limbs supported by an iron frame!</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;Why, where&#8217;s our Martha?&#8217; cried Bob Cratchit looking round.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;Not coming,&#8217; said Mrs. Cratchit.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;Not coming!&#8217; said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits; for he had been Tim&#8217;s blood
			horse all the way from church, and had come home rampant. &#8216;Not coming upon Christmas Day!&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;Martha didn&#8217;t like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so she came out prematurely
			from behind the closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim,
			and bore him off into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;And how did little Tim behave?&#8217; asked Mrs. Cratchit, when she had rallied Bob on his credulity,
			and Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart&#8217;s content.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;As good as gold,&#8217; said Bob, &#8216;and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful sitting by himself so
			much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the
			people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember
			upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;Bob&#8217;s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim
			was growing strong and hearty.</p>

			<p>&#8216;His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny Tim before another word
			was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister to his stool beside the fire; and while Bob, turning up
			his cuffs, as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made less shabby, compounded some hot
			mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round, and put it on the hob to simmer;
			Master Peter and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they
			soon returned in high procession.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds; a feathered
			phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course: and, in truth, it was something very like
			it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy (ready before-hand in a little saucepan) hissing
			hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce;
			Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table;
			the two young Cratchits set chairs for every body, not forgetting themselves, and, mounting guard
			upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their
			turn came to be helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a
			breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it
			in the breast; but when she did, and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur
			of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits,
			beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!</p>

			<p>&#8216;There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn&#8217;t believe there ever was such a goose cooked.
			Its tenderness and flavor, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration. Eked out
			by the apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as
			Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish,) they hadn&#8217;t
			ate it all at last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular, were steeped
			in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs.
			Cratchit left the room alone&#8212;too nervous to bear witnesses&#8212;to take the pudding up, and bring
			it in.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning out! Suppose somebody
			should have got over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they were merry with the
			goose: a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were
			supposed.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell like a washing-day!
			That was the cloth. A smell like an eating house, and a pastry cook&#8217;s next door to each other, with a
			laundress&#8217;s next door to that? That was the pudding. In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit entered:
			flushed, but smiling proudly: with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing
			in half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;Oh, a wonderful pudding!&#8217; Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he regarded it as the greatest
			success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that now the weight was
			off her mind, she would confide she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had
			something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family.
			It would have been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing.</p>

			<p>&#8216;At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up. The
			compound in the jug being tasted and considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table,
			and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth,
			in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and at Bob Cratchit&#8217;s elbow stood the family
			display of glass; two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.</p>

			<p>&#8216;These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden goblets would have done: and
			Bob served it out with beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and crackled noisily.
			Then Bob proposed:</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;Which all the family re-echoed.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;God bless us every one!&#8217; said Tiny Tim, last of all.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>279</span>&#8216;He sat very close to his father&#8217;s side, upon his little stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his,
			as if he loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from
			him.&#8217;</p>
		</div>

		<p>Could any thing be more life-like, more beautiful, more touching, than this description?
		But let us skip the journeyings of Christmas Present for a moment, that we may accompany
		Christmas to Come to the dwelling of poor <span class="special_name">Bob Cratchit</span>:</p>

		<div class="quotation">
			<p>&#8216;The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet; and as they went along,
			Scrooge looked here and there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor
			Bob Cratchit&#8217;s house; the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the children
			seated round the fire.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking
			up at Peter, who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing.
			But surely they were very quiet!</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy must have read
			them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshhold. Why did he not go on?</p>

			<p>&#8216;The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her face.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;The color hurts my eyes,&#8217; she said.</p>

			<p>&#8216;The color? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;They&#8217;re better now again,&#8217; said Cratchit&#8217;s wife. &#8216;It makes them weak by candle-light; and
			I wouldn&#8217;t show weak eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It must be near his
			time.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;Past it, rather,&#8217; Peter answered, shutting up his book. &#8216;But I think he&#8217;s walked a little slower
			than he used, these few last evenings, mother.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered
			once:</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;I have known him walk with&#8212;I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very
			fast, indeed.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;And so have I,&#8217; cried Peter. &#8216;Often.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;And so have I!&#8217; exclaimed another. So had all.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;But he was very light to carry,&#8217; she resumed, intent upon her work, &#8216;and his father loved him
			so, that it was no trouble&#8212;no trouble. And there is your father at the door!&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;She hurried out to meet him; and Bob in his comforter&#8212;he had need of it, poor fellow&#8212;came
			in. His tea was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then
			the two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against his face, as if
			they said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t mind it, father. Don&#8217;t be grieved!&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family. He looked at the work
			upon the table, and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be
			done long before Sunday, he said.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;Sunday! You went to-day then, Robert?&#8217; said his wife.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;Yes, my dear,&#8217; returned Bob. &#8216;I wish you could have gone. It would have done you good to
			see how green a place it is. But you&#8217;ll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a
			Sunday. My little, little child!&#8217; cried Bob. &#8216;My little child!&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;He broke down all at once. He couldn&#8217;t help it. If he could have helped it, he and his child
			would have been further apart, perhaps, than they were.</p>

			<p>&#8216;He left the room, and went up stairs into the room above, which was lighted cheerfully, and hung
			with Christmas. There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were signs of some one having
			been there lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed himself,
			he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what had happened, and went down again quite happy.&#8217;</p>

		</div>

		<p>&#8216;Let not that man be trusted&#8217; who can read this affecting picture of parental love for a
		poor little cripple-boy, without feeling the tear-drops swelling to his eyes. But let us return
		and take one more excursion with the former Spirit. Observe the faithfulness and the range
		of the writer&#8217;s imagination:</p>

		<div class="quotation">
			<p>&#8216;And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a bleak and desert moor,
			where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place of giants;
			and water spread itself wheresoever it listed&#8212;or would have done so, but for the frost that held it
			prisoner; and nothing-grew but moss and furze, and coarse, rank grass. Down in the west the setting
			sun had left a streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,
			and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;What place is this?&#8217; asked Scrooge.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&#8216;A place where Miners live, who labor in the bowels of the earth,&#8217; returned the Spirit. &#8216;But they
			know me. See!&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced toward it. Passing through
			the wall of mud and stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old,
			old man and woman, with their children and their children&#8217;s children, and another generation beyond
			that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire. The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the
			howling of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a very
			old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined in the chorus. So surely as they
			raised their voices, the old man got quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigor
			sank again.</p>

			<p>&#8216;The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and passing on above the moor, sped
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>280</span>whither? Not to sea? To sea. To Scrooge&#8217;s horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a
			frightful range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it
			rolled, and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine
			the earth.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from the shore, on which the waters
			chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed
			clung to its base, and storm-birds&#8212;born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the
			water&#8212;rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.</p>

			<p>&#8216;But even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that through the loophole in the
			thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the
			rough table at which they sat, they wished each other a Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and
			one of them&#8212;the elder, too, with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather, as the figurehead
			of an old ship might be&#8212;struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in itself.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea&#8212;on, on&#8212;until, being far away, as he
			told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel,
			the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations:
			but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke
			below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging
			to it. And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another
			on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities: and had
			remembered those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.&#8217;</p>

		</div>

		<p>The second of these spirits accompanies <span class="special_name">Scrooge</span> to a scene that is well worth seeing,
		and the like of which many of our readers have doubtless often encountered&#8212;a regular
		Christmas frolic; in the present instance at the residence of his nephew, who has a sister,
		a lovely, plump damsel, with a lace tucker: she was pretty, exceedingly pretty. &#8216;With a
		dimpled, surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made to be kissed,
		as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one
		another when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature&#8217;s
		head. Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but
		satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory!&#8217; Is not the following a most glowing sketch
		of a well known pastime?</p>

		<div class="quotation">
			<p>&#8216;But they didn&#8217;t devote the whole evening to music. After a while they played at forfeits; for it is
			good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a
			child himself. Stop! There was first a game at blindman&#8217;s buff. Of course there was. And I no
			more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it
			was a done thing between him and Scrooge&#8217;s nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew
			it. The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the credulity of
			human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping up against the piano,
			smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went, there went he. He always knew where
			the plump sister was. He wouldn&#8217;t catch any body else. If you had fallen up against him, as some
			of them did, and stood there; he would have made a feint endeavoring to seize you, which would
			have been an affront to your understanding: and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of
			the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn&#8217;t fair; and it really was not. But when, at last, he
			caught her; when, in spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got her
			into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending
			not to know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and farther
			to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain about
			her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told him her opinion of it, when, another blindman
			being in office, they were so very confidential together, behind the curtains.&#8217;</p>

		</div>

		<p>The Ghost of Christmas to Come is the third spirit. It is a stately figure, surrounded in
		black and impenetrable drapery. It leads <span class="special_name">Scrooge</span> into the heart of the city, and he hears
		his acquaintance talking jestingly of one departed; into the Exchange, and he sees another
		standing against his peculiar pillar; into a haunt of infamy, where wretches are dividing
		the spoils and hoardings of the dead; into a wretched room, where a corpse lies shrouded,
		whose face Scrooge dares not uncover; into dwellings made miserable by the grasping
		avarice of those who had wealth they could not use; into his nephew&#8217;s house, shorn of its
		comforts, where the inmates, care-worn and weary, are wringing their hands with distress;
		into poor <span class="special_name">Bob Cratchit&#8217;s</span> abode, made cheerless by death; and lastly, into a sad churchyard,
		where, on the stone of a neglected grave, is inscribed his own name! He implores
		the spirit to say whether these shadows may not be changed by an altered life. Its trembling
		hand seems to give consent. He pleads earnestly for a more decisive sign, and while
		he does so, the phantom dwindles down into a bed-post, and <span class="special_name">Scrooge</span> sits upright in his
		bed. Who cannot imagine the conclusion? It is broad day. He looks out of the window:
		<span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>281</span>the bells are ringing; the people are going to church; all proclaim it as Christmas Day.
		The future is yet before him, and he is resolved to make the most of it. The prize turkey
		is got in haste from the neighboring poulterer&#8217;s, and sent by a cab to <span class="special_name">Bob Cratchit&#8217;s</span>; and

		1824 and 1840. By <span class="special_name keep_together">P. D. Holthaus</span>, Journeyman Tailor, from Werdohl, in Westphalia. Translated
		from the third German edition, by <span class="special_name">William Howitt</span>. <span class="special_name">J. Winchester</span>: &#8216;New World&#8217;
		Press.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">An</span> air of great simplicity and truth pervades this wander-book of the German schneider.
		Mr. <span class="special_name">Howitt</span> tells us, that when in the autumn of 1840 he returned to his native village, a
		great reputation preceded him, and all came, eager to see the brave traveller, and to listen
		to the relation of his adventures. He never sought purposely to turn conversation upon
		the subject of his travels, nor to impress an idea of his own importance; but when he was
		drawn into discourse, it was speedily found that he had noted and deeply impressed on his
		mind every thing with a truly admirable interest, and an acute spirit of observation, for
		one of his rank and education; that he had not merely passed through the countries, but
		had gleaned valuable matter on his journey; various things which he had brought with
		him testified this interest, such as different kinds of coin, engravings, plans of cities, etc.
		We have found, on an examination necessarily cursory, the commendatory remarks of the
		Berlin <i>Gesellschafter</i> upon this work to be well deserved: &#8216;We see in the individual expressions
		almost every where the evidence of its being the production of immediate observation.
		There prevails through the whole a noble simplicity and singleness of purpose, a
		genuinely German sound mode of thinking; here and there is not wanting a humorous and
		pithy remark. The author sees in every place nature and men without spectacles, and
		thence it arises that we acquire from his book a more living and actual view of foreign
		countries, especially of Egypt, Palestine, and Turkey, than was the case from the travelled
		labors of many a learned and celebrated man. Frequently, nay almost always, it is a fact,
		that the learned are destitute of the opportunity of acquiring a knowledge of the real life
		of the people, while it is exactly here that the greatest peculiarity of the manners and customs
		of foreigners is to be found. Our honest hand-worker lived among the people, and
		therefore possessed the best means to describe them in graphic characters.&#8217; There is something
		very forcible and comprehensive in the subjoined passage from the author&#8217;s preface.
		It is indeed a sort of compendium of the most interesting portion of the writer&#8217;s journeyings:</p>

			<p>&#8216;From my youth up, it was my most living desire to see the world. When I heard or read of foreign
			lands, I became sad at heart, and thought: &#8216;Wert thou but of years that thou couldst travel!&#8217; Now
			are all the wishes of my youth fulfilled. I have made the attempt by land and water, and that in
			three quarters of the world. I have wandered several times through <span class="special_name">Germany</span>, <span class="first_word">Poland</span>, <span class="first_word">Hungary</span>,
			and <span class="special_name">Wallachia</span>; I was a long time in <span class="special_name">Budapest</span> and <span class="special_name">Constantinople</span>; and undertook, with the
			money which I had saved there, a pilgrimage through <span class="special_name">Egypt</span> to the <span class="special_name">Holy Land</span>. I kneeled at the
			<span class="special_name">Birth-Place</span> and the <span class="special_name">Sepulchre</span> of the <span class="special_name">Saviour</span>; stood in adoration on the holy <span class="special_name">Mount Zion</span>,
			on <span class="special_name">Tabor</span>, <span class="special_name">Golgotha</span>, and the <span class="special_name">Mount of Olives</span>; bathed in <span class="special_name">Jordan</span>; washed myself in the <span class="special_name">Lake
			of Gennesareth</span>; looked in vain around me on the <span class="special_name">Dead Sea</span> for living objects; was in the workshop
			of <span class="special_name">St. Joseph</span>; and in many other holy places of which the sacred Scriptures make mention.
			Thence I returned to Constantinople, and betook myself through Athens, where I worked nearly a
			year, and thence through Italy, France, and Belgium, homeward to my Fatherland.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">This</span> work contains a copious selection of those passages in the works of <span class="special_name">Jeremy Bentham</span>
		which appear to be chiefly distinguished for merit of a simply rhetorical character;
		which, appearing often in the midst of long and arduous processes of reasoning, or in the
		course of elaborate descriptions of minute practical arrangements, demanding from an
		active mind severe thought and unflagging attention, have scarcely had their due weight
		with the general reader, nor secured their just meed of admiration. He was singularly
		careless, writes his editor, in distributing his pleasing illustrations of playfulness, or pathos,
		or epigrammatic expression. His &#8216;mission&#8217; he considered to be that of an instructor and
		improver; and the flowers which, equally with more substantial things, were the produce
		of his vigorous intellect, he looked upon as scarcely worthy of passing attention, and deserving
		of no more notice than to be permitted to grow wherever the more valued objects
		of his labors left them a little room. The volume comprehends a vast variety of sound
		opinion, and able though brief argument upon themes which relate to the social, moral
		and religious well-being of mankind. Touching the style of the writer, as evinced in these
		selections, we should say that it was formed mainly upon a due avoidance of prolixity, (an
		observance not always characteristic of <span class="special_name">Bentham&#8217;s</span> writings,) concerning which he himself
		very justly remarks: &#8216;Prolixity may be where redundancy is not. Prolixity may arise
		not only from the multifarious insertion of unnecessary articles, but from the conservation
		of too many necessary ones in a sentence; as a workman may be overladen not only with
		rubbish, which is of no use for him to carry, but with materials the most useful and necessary,
		when heaped up in loads too heavy for him at once.&#8217; A useful hint this, to unpractised
		writers.</p>

		and the state of preservation of the original manuscripts being given in the preface. But
		we are very sorry to say so much against the book as this fact implies. It would be far better
		for the reputation of the immortal Bard of Scotland, if some hereditary friend, chary of his
		undying fame, were to come before the public with a pamphlet disproving entirely the
		agency of <span class="special_name">Burns</span> in this correspondence. To those who are acquainted with previous records
		in the private history of the world-renowned poet, it is painful to convict him, out

		we can well believe; but that the &#8216;platonic attachment,&#8217; which sprung up in a night, like
		the gourd of <span class="special_name">Jonah</span>, and gradually waxed to &#8216;passion at fever-heat,&#8217; was justified by these

		<div class="ed_table_item">
			<p><span class="ed_table_title">Some &#8216;Sentiments&#8217; on Sonnets, with sundry Specimens.</span>&#8212;Thanks to our ever-welcome
			correspondent, &#8216;<span class="special_name keep_together">T. W. P.</span>&#8217; for his pleasant, pertinent and improving sentiments on
			sonnets. Arriving at too late an hour for a place among our guests at the <i>table d&#8217; hôte</i>, perhaps
			he will not object to sit at our humble side-table, and converse familiarly with the reader;
			since, as honest <span class="special_name">Sancho</span> remarked of the Duke, &#8216;Wherever <em>he</em> sits, there will be the <em>first
			place</em>.&#8217; Our friend has a fruitful theme. How many borrowed prose-passages have we seen,
			with their original brightness dimmed or deflected in a sorry sonnet! Nine in ten of our modern
			examples in this kind, when one comes to analyze them, will be found to consist of stolen
			ideas, combined with what <span class="special_name">Southey</span> would call &#8216;bubble, and bladder, and tympany.&#8217;
			But perpend the subjoined: &#8216;Ever since the fatal days of <span class="special_name">Petrarch and Guido Cavalianti</span>,
			mankind have suffered more or less from the chronic infliction of Sonnets. With
			them indeed the complaint was constitutional, and came in the natural way; under so mild
			and gentle a form withal, that little danger was to be apprehended for Italian temperaments,
			except a degree of languor, general debility, and a disagreeable singing in the ears. It was
			only when it worked its way into English blood, that the virus assumed its most baneful
			character. <span class="special_name">Shakspeare</span>, among other illustrious victims, was afflicted by it in his youth, but
			seems to have recovered during his residence in the metropolis. Possibly the favor of the
			royal hand might have proved more beneficial than that of the Earl of Southampton.
			Perhaps he was <em>touched</em> for it by <span class="special_name">Elizabeth</span>, as <span class="special_name">Johnson</span> was by Queen <span class="special_name">Anne</span> for the
			scrofula. However that may be, we know very well that the disorder is now rooted among
			us, and that every week produces decided cases of Sonnets, sometimes so severe as to be
			intolerable. In this condition of the mental health of our country, since the evil cannot be
			cured, it were a work at once philanthropical and patriotic, so to modify it and regulate its
			attacks, that it may settle down into a moderate degree of annoyance, like the lighter afflictions
			of mild measles and mumps. We can always calculate upon the duration of each
			&#8216;fytte,&#8217; as none ever exceeds the fourteenth spasm. When the just dozen-and-two convulsions
			are past, the danger is over, and the offensive matter may be removed by a newspaper,
			or discharged into some appropriate magazine. There is good reason for designating the
			complaint as a <em>periodical</em> one.</p>

			<p>We intend, one of these days, provided our remarks attract sufficient attention, to publish
			a volume upon this subject. We have the materiel by us and about us; and as soon as we
			can make arrangements with Mr. <span class="special_name">Poh</span> for a puff in the &#8216;North-American Review,&#8217; or the
			&#8216;Southern Literary Messenger,&#8217; we shall broach the affair to Mr. <span class="special_name">Fields</span>, the enterprising
			publisher. We have moreover desired Mr. <span class="special_name">Whipple</span> to write to his friend Mr. <span class="special_name">Macaulay</span>
			in England, who will doubtless be proud to foster American letters by a hoist in the &#8216;Edinburgh.&#8217;
			There is only one other thing absolutely requisite for the success of the book, and
			that is the appearance of this article in the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>. Befriend me then with
			your fine taste, renowned <span class="special_name">Herr Diedrich</span>! and give me room. I shall not dive deeply into
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>284</span>the matter now; but for the good of my young countrymen, the labor of whose brains is
			incompatible with a fruitful development of whiskers, I wish to put forth a page of advice
			that may save them a world of fatigue. It is common with those who are far gone in this
			tuneful disorder to set up late o&#8217; nights and tipple coffee. Under my new system, I will
			engage that they may retire to bed on mulled-punch nightly, at eleven, and yet effect all
			that they now perform with the greatest injury to their eyes and complexions. But <i>pocas
			pallabras</i>&#8212;enough of this preface: will not the thing speak for itself? There needs no
			farther introduction for these brief extracts from the aforesaid work:</p>

			<h3 class="title">THE EASIEST WAY OF DISCHARGING A SONNET.</h3>

			<p><span class="first_word">A Sonnet</span> (as before stated) consists of fourteen and no more spasms. They are calm,
			deliberate twinges, however, and upon a homœopathical principle, the great object should
			be to get over each one in the calmest possible manner; <i>idem cum eodem</i>. The thing cannot
			be treated too coolly, for its very essence is dull deliberation. The name sonnet is probably
			derived, through the Italian <i>sonno</i>, from the Latin word for sleep, in allusion to its
			lethargic quality. The best mode of encouraging the efflux of the peccant humor is for
			the patient to have a cigar in his mouth. The narcotic fumes of tobacco are highly favorable
			to its ejection. The first step then is the selection of rhymes. Fourteen of these
			in their proper order should be written perpendicularly on the right hand of a smooth sheet
			of white paper. When this is done, it is necessary to read them over, up and down, several
			times, until some general idea of a subject or a title suggests itself. Great care must be
			taken, in the selection of rhymes, to get as original ones as possible, and such as shall strike
			the eye. Still greater should be the precaution not to choose such incongruous rhymes as
			may not easily be welded together or amalgamated into one whole by the mercury of fancy.
			For instance, it would be well to avoid coupling such words as moon and spoon, breeze
			and cheese and sneeze; Jove and stove; hope and soap; all which it might be difficult to
			bring together harmoniously. Here the artist, the man of true science, will discover himself.
			<span class="special_name">Shelley</span> affords a good choice of rhymes; chasm and spasm; rift and drift; ravine
			and savin, are useful conjunctions. If you have a ravine, it will be very easy to stick in
			a savin, but you must avoid a <em>spavin</em>, or your verse may halt for it. This we call being artistical.
			<i>Benissimo!</i> then. Having fixed upon your subject, all you have to do is to fill up
			the lines to match the ends, and this, in one evening&#8217;s practice, will become as easy, the
			same thing in fact, as the filling up of the blank form of an ordinary receipt.</p>

			<p>But the most expeditious and surest way of procuring a good Sonnet is the Division of
			Labor System. This has often been unconsciously practised by modern poets, but it has never
			been explicitly set forth till now. Every body knows that even in the fabrication of so
			small a thing as a needle, the process is facilitated by dividing it among a number of hands;
			as to one the eye, to another the point, to one the grinding, to another the polishing. In
			the same way, to render a sonnet pointed and sharp, to polish it and insure it against cutting
			the thread of its argument, the work should be performed by two or more. Every sonnet,
			in short, ought to be a translation. I do not say a translation from the German or any
			other jargon, but a translation from English&#8212;from one man&#8217;s into another man&#8217;s English.
			It is absurd for one workman to do both rhyming and thinking. In this go-ahead age and
			country, that were a palpable waste of time. Take any &#8216;matter-ful&#8217; author, cut out a
			juicy slice of his thought, and make that your material. Trim it, compress it, turn it and
			twist it upside down and inside out, vary it any way but the author&#8217;s own, and you will be
			likely to effect a speedy and wholesome operation. What a saving of time is here! Who
			will be silly enough to manufacture his own thinkings into verse when the world is so full of
			excellent stuff as yet unwrought in the great mine of letters? Let us not burn up our own
			native forests while we can fetch coals from Newcastle. What a pleasant prospect for readers
			too! A man may be sure <em>then</em>, that a sonnet shall contain a thought. He will not be
			gulled into experiments upon decent-looking, respectable dross and plausible inanity. He
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>285</span>shall not dig hungrily for an idea, and be filled with volumes of wind. With the fourteenth
			pang his anxiety shall be over, and he shall drop asleep satisfied; <i>tandem dormitum
			dimittitur</i>.</p>

			<p>Not to anticipate farther our forthcoming book, nor to forestall the critics in any more
			extracts, we shall lay before the reader two or three samples of work done according to
			this system. <span class="special_name">Carlyle</span> has furnished our raw material. His pages are so full of poetry
			that little time need be expended in selecting a fit piece for working up. See now if these
			be not sonnets which <span class="special_name">Bowles</span> might have been proud to claim. Each one is warranted
			to contain a thought; an hour or so would suffice for the completion of half a dozen such.
			Observe too, that little deviation is necessary from the original, the words falling naturally
			into both rhythm and rhyme. We commence with a few translations from Carlyle. The
			initial specimen is taken from Herr <span class="special_name">Teufelsdröckh&#8217;s</span> remarks on <span class="special_name">Bonaparte</span>. This is
			the passage:</p>

			<div class="quotation">
				<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">The</span> man (<span class="special_name">Napoleon</span>) was a Divine Missionary, though unconscious of it, and preached through

				handle them.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> Madly enough he preached, it is true, as Enthusiasts and first Missionaries are
				wont, with imperfect utterance, amid much frothy rant, yet as articulately perhaps as the case admitted.

			<p>&#8216;<span class="ed_table_title">Legends of the Conquest of Spain</span>.&#8217;&#8212;Some eighteen years ago, a work in a single
			volume, entitled as above, and written by the author of the &#8216;Sketch-Book,&#8217; was issued from
			the press of <span class="special_name">Murray</span>, the celebrated London book-seller. It would seem to have been put
			forth as a kind of <i>avant-courier</i> of &#8216;The Chronicles of the Conquest of Granada;&#8217; but unlike
			that elaborate work, was never republished in this country, and has never been included
			in any of the complete editions of Mr. <span class="special_name">Irving&#8217;s</span> writings. We are indebted to
			the kind courtesy of a gentleman who has been spending some months with our distinguished
			countryman and correspondent at Madrid, for a copy of the book, which he obtained
			at that capital. We have good reason to believe that it has been encountered by few if
			any readers on this side the Atlantic. A very stirring extract from its pages will be found
			elsewhere in this Magazine. Mr. <span class="special_name">Irving</span> introduces the legends to his readers with a few
			prefatory sentences, in which he states that he has ventured to dip more deeply into the
			enchanted fountains of old Spanish chronicle than has usually been done by those who
			have treated of the eventful period of which he writes; but in so doing, he only more fully
			illustrates the character of the people and the times. He has thrown the records into the
			form of legends, not claiming for them the authenticity of sober history, yet giving nothing
			that had not a historical foundation. &#8216;All the facts herein contained,&#8217; says the writer,
			&#8216;however extravagant some of them may be deemed, will be found in the works of sage
			and reverend chroniclers of yore, growing side by side with long acknowledged truths, and
			might be supported by learned and imposing references in the margin.&#8217; To discard every
			thing wild and marvellous in this portion of Spanish history is to discard some of its most
			beautiful, instructive, and national features; it is to judge of Spain by the standard of probability
			suited to tamer and more prosaic countries. Spain is virtually a land of poetry and
			romance, where every-day life partakes of adventure, and where the least agitation or excitement
			carries every thing up into extravagant enterprise and daring exploit. The Spaniards
			in all ages have been of swelling and braggart spirit, soaring in thought, and valiant
			though vainglorious in deed. When the nation had recovered in some degree from the
			storm of Moslem invasion, and sage men sought to inquire and write the particulars of the
			tremendous reverses which it produced, it was too late to ascertain them in their exact
			verity. The gloom and melancholy that had overshadowed the land had given birth to a
			thousand superstitious fancies; the woes and terrors of the past were clothed with supernatural
			miracles and portents, and the actors in the fearful drama had already assumed the
			dubious characteristics of romance. Or if a writer from among the conquerors undertook
			to touch upon the theme, it was embellished with all the wild extravagances of an oriental
			imagination, which afterward stole into the graver works of the monkish historians. Hence
			the chronicles are apt to be tinctured with those saintly miracles which savor of the pious
			labors of the cloister, or those fanciful fictions that betray their Arabian Authors. Scarce
			one of their historical facts but has been connected in the original with some romantic
			fiction, and even in its divorced state, bears traces of its former alliance. The records in
			preceding pages are &#8216;illuminated&#8217; by these prefatory remarks of our author, if their <em>truth</em>
			be not altogether established! How the Count <span class="special_name">Julian</span> receives the account of the dishonor
			of his child, and his conduct thereupon; and how <span class="special_name">Don Roderick</span> hastens, through various
			tribulation, to his final overthrow; will be matter for another number. Meanwhile the
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>288</span>reader will not fail to note the great beauty of the descriptions, which in the hands of our
			great master of the power and beauty of &#8216;the grand old English tongue,&#8217; assume form and
			color, and stand out like living pictures to the eye.</p>

			<p><span class="ed_table_title">American Ptyalism: &#8216;Quid Rides?&#8217;</span>&#8212;A pleasant correspondent, whom our readers
			have long known, and as long admired and esteemed, in a familiar gossip, (by favor of
			&#8216;Uncle <span class="special_name">Samuel&#8217;s</span> mail-bag,) with the Editor, gives us the following &#8216;running account&#8217; of
			his ruminations over an early-morning quid of that &#8216;flavorous weed&#8217; so well beloved of our
			friend Colonel <span class="special_name">Stone</span>. It is in some sort a defence of American ptyalism, and in the tendency
			of its inculcations, reminds us of the arguments in favor of the cultivation of a refined
			style of <em>murder</em>, which should constitute it one of the fine arts, to which we gave a place
			many months back: &#8216;After having in my broken dreams perambulated every part and
			parcel of the universe, and then tossed about for hours on an ocean of bodily discomforts,
			each a dagger to repose, and mental disquietudes, of which any one was enough to wither
			all the poppies of Somnus, I rose about four o&#8217; my watch, and commenced chewing the
			narcotic weed of Virginia. For you must know that in childhood almost, through a precocious
			mannishness and a desire of experimental knowledge, I commenced the habit of
			tobacco-chewing, and the vice born of a freak, has &#8216;grown with my growth,&#8217; till now it
			holds me as in a &#8216;vice&#8217; screwed up and secured by a giant. (Please observe that there&#8217;s a
			pun in that last sentence.) Where the conventionalities of society compel me to attidunize
			my appearance and customs into the stiffness of gentility, I puff the Havana; but
			when the privacy of my own room or the solitude of the roads and fields permit me to vulgarize
			to my liking, I thrust a ball of &#8216;Mrs. <span class="special_name">Miller&#8217;s</span> fine-cut,&#8217; or a fragment of the &#8216;natural
			James&#8217; River sweet,&#8217; between the sub-maxillary bone and its carnal casement, and
			then masticate and expectorate &#8216;à la Yankee.&#8217; or &#8216;more Americano.&#8217; Pah! oh! fie! for
			shame! and all other interjections indicative of horror, or expressive of disgust. &#8216;<i>Quousque
			tandem?</i>&#8217; Beg your pardon, Mrs. <span class="special_name">Trollope</span>. &#8216;<i>Quamdiu etiam?</i>&#8217; I implore your commiseration,
			Captain <span class="special_name">Basil</span>. &#8216;<i>Oh, tempora! oh, mores!</i>&#8217; Have mercy, illustrious and praise-bespattered,
			and almost Sir-Waltered <span class="special_name">Boz</span>. Do not, under the uneasy weight of glory, and
			in the intoxicating consciousness of a right to the oligarchic exclusiveness of the goose-quill
			&#8216;haute volèe,&#8217; strike right and left among your sturdy democratic adorers, because
			they choose to convert their mandibles into quid-grinders, and their <span class="greek_text" title="chasmat' odontôn">χασματ᾿ ὀδόντων</span> into
			ceaseless jet d&#8217;eaux of saliva. Reflect that the &#8216;quid&#8217; assists in a philosophic investigation
			of the &#8216;quiddities&#8217; of things, and that from this habit alone perhaps we have made such
			advances in casuistry as to have discovered equity in repudiation, freedom in mobocracy,
			and the sword of justice in the bowie-knife. Chewing is eminently democratic, since all
			chewers are &#8216;pro hâc <em>vice</em>&#8217; on a perfect equality, and a &#8216;millionaire;&#8217; or, for that matter, a
			&#8216;billionaire,&#8217; if we had him, would not hesitate to take out of his mouth a moiety of his
			last &#8216;chew&#8217; and give it to an itinerant Lazarus. What can be more admirable than this
			&#8216;de bon air&#8217; plebeianism, and universal right-hand of fellowship? Does not he who extends
			among the people the use of this democratizing weed, emphatically give them a &#8216;<em>quid</em> pro
			quo?&#8217; Are not slovenliness and filth the virtues of republics, while neatness and elegance
			are vices of court-growth, and expand into their most ramified and minute perfectness of
			polish only in the palaces of kings? Furthermore, oh laurelled and triumphant <span class="special_name">Pickwick</span>!
			if expectoration be filthy, it must be because the &#8216;thing expectorated&#8217; is unclean; and if so,
			is it not more decent to become rid of the &#8216;unclean thing&#8217; by the readiest process, than to
			retain it, making the stomach a receptacle of abominations? And are you, Sir Baronet of
			the realm imaginary, subject to no gross corporeal needs and operations? And if, as
			you will say, you perform those foul rites in a state of retiracy, are you not adding the
			sin of hypocrisy to your preëxistent guilt? If it has succeeded to you, as to few penny-a-liners,
			to have emerged by the sale of your Attic-salt from the attics of Grub-street
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name="page289"></a>289</span>into the &#8216;swept and garnished chambers&#8217; of the Regent, and if after quaffing
			the ale of Bow-street, procured by caricatures of Old Baily reports, you have sipped your
			hockheimer, while standing, scarce yet unbewildered, in the gas-light splendor reflected
			from the &#8216;vis-á-vis&#8217; mirrors of Almack&#8217;s, yet do not exalt yourself above all that
			is fleshly. Reflect that you, so lately unrivalled, can now see a <span class="special_name">Eugene Sue</span> whose brow
			is umbraged by laurels of a more luxuriant and lovely green. Cease your expectorations
			of bile upon a great people; admit that mastication of the &#8216;odorous vegeble&#8217; is a
			Spartan virtue; and we will again vote you an Anak in the kingdom of pen and paper.
			Then again shall we be led to believe that your praises and your vituperations are
			equally unpurchasable. Then once more shall we think you would swallow no golden pill,
			nor suffer your throat to be ulcerated by a silver quinsy.&#8217;</p>

				<p><span class="ed_table_title">Gossip With Readers and Correspondents.</span>&#8212;If any of our readers are desirous of
				looking into the <em>rationale</em> of irrationality, to employ a highly &#8216;unitive&#8217; phrase, let them take
				up, if they can command it, the &#8216;<i>Annual Report of the Managers of the New York State
				Lunatic Asylum</i>,&#8217; one of the clearest and most comprehensive documents in its kind that
				we have ever perused. It proceeds from the capable pen of <span class="special_name keep_together">A. Brigham, M. D.</span> the superintendent
				and physician of the institution, and is full upon the definition, causes and classification
				of insanity; the size and shape of the heads of the patients; the pulse; description
				of the building; daily routine of business, diet, labor, amusements, religious worship,
				visitors, suggestions to those who have friends whom they expect to commit to the care of
				the asylum, etc., etc. The cause of insanity in <em>fifty</em> out of two hundred and seventy-six
				patients is attributed to religious anxiety, produced by long attendance on protracted religious
				meetings, etc. Want of sleep is decidedly the most frequent and immediate cause of
				insanity, and one the most important to guard against. &#8216;So rarely (says the superintendent)
				do you see a recent case of insanity that is not preceded by want of sleep, that we regard
				it as almost the sure precursor of mental derangement.&#8217; As evidences of the difficulty of
				arranging the insane in classes, founded on symptoms, Dr. <span class="special_name">Brigham</span> gives us the following
				synopsis of individual peculiarities noticed among certain of the inmates of the Asylum:</p>

				<div class="quotation">
					<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">In</span> addition to emperors, queens, prophets and priests, we have one that says he is nobody, a nonentity.
					One that was never born, and one that was born of her grandmother, and another dropped
					by the devil flying over the world. One has had the throat cut out and put in wrong, so that what is
					swallowed passes into the head, and another has his head cut off and replaced every night. One thinks
					himself a child, and talks and acts like a child. Many appear as if constantly intoxicated. One has
					the gift of tongues, another deals in magic, several in animal magnetism. One thinks he is a white
					polar bear. A number have hallucinations of sight, others of hearing. One repeats whatever is said
					to him, another repeats constantly words of the same sound, as door, floor. One is pursued by the
					sheriff, many by the devil. One has invented the perpetual motion and is soon to be rich; others
					have already acquired vast fortunes: scraps of paper, buttons and chips are to them, large amounts
					of money. Many pilfer continually and without any apparent motive, while others secrete every
					thing they can find, their own articles as well as those of others. A majority are disposed to hoard up
					trifling and useless articles, as scraps of tin, leather, strings, nails, buttons, etc., and are much grieved
					to part with them. One will not eat unless alone, some never wish to eat, while others are always
					starving. One with a few sticks and straws fills his room with officers and soldiers, ships and sailors,
					carriages and horses, the management of which occupies all his time and thoughts. Some have good
					memory as regards most things, and singularly defective as to others. One does not recollect the
					names of his associates, which he hears every hour, yet his memory is good in other respects. One
					says he is <span class="special_name">Thomas Paine</span>, author of the &#8216;Age of Reason,&#8217; a work he has never read; another calls
					himself General <span class="special_name">Washington</span>; and one old lady of diminutive size calls herself General <span class="special_name">Scott</span>,
					and is never so good-natured as when thus addressed. One is always in court attending a trial, and
					wondering and asking when the court is to rise. Another has to eat up the building, drink dry the
					canal, and swallow the Little Falls village, and is continually telling of the difficulty of the task.&#8217;</p>

				</div>

				<p>The superintendent prefers a classification founded upon the faculties of the mind that
				appear to be disordered; and he thinks he could place all his patients in one of the three
				following classes: <em>Intellectual Insanity</em>, or disorder of the intellect without noticeable disturbance
				of the feelings and propensities; <em>Moral Insanity</em> or derangement of the feelings, affections,
				and passions, without any remarkable disorder of the intellect; and <em>General Insanity</em>,
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>290</span>in which both the intellectual faculties and the feelings and affections are disordered.
				The State Asylum is a fine imposing edifice, delightfully situated near the pleasant village
				of Utica, in Oneida county, and is becoming greatly distinguished for success in the treatment
				and cure of insanity. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">We</span> heard a little anecdote at a <i>bal costumé</i> the other

				<p><span class="first_word">Our</span> umqwhile New-Haven friend, who commented upon our &#8216;light gossip&#8217; a few months
				since, will pardon us for quoting, in corroboration of the exculpatory &#8216;position&#8217; which we
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>291</span>assumed in alluding to his animadversions, the following remarks by the author of the
				&#8216;Charcoal Sketches,&#8217; <span class="special_name">Joseph C. Neal</span>, Esq.: &#8216;Gossip, goodly gossip, though sometimes
				sneered at, is after all the best of our entertainments. We must fall back upon the light
				web of conversation, upon chit-chat, as our main-stay, our chief reliance; as that <i>corps de
				reserve</i> on which our scattered and wearied forces are to rally. What is there which will
				bear comparison as a recreating means, with the free and unstudied interchange of thought,
				of knowledge, of impression about men and things, and all that varied medley of fact,
				criticism and conclusion so continually fermenting in the active brain? Be fearful of those
				who love it not, and banish such as would imbibe its delights yet bring no contribution
				to the common stock. There are men who seek the reputation of wisdom by dint of never
				affording a glimpse of their capabilities, and impose upon the world by silent gravity; negative
				philosophers, who never commit themselves beyond the utterance of a self-evident proposition,
				or hazard their position by a feat of greater boldness than is to be found in the
				avowal of the safe truth which has been granted for a thousand years. There is a deception
				here, which should never be submitted to. Sagacity may be manifest in the nod of
				Burleigh&#8217;s head; but it does not follow that all who nod are Burleighs. He who habitually
				says nothing, must be content if he be regarded as having nothing to say, and it is only a
				lack of grace on his part which precludes the confession. In this broad &#8216;Vienna&#8217; of human
				effort, the mere &#8216;looker-on&#8217; cannot be tolerated. It is part of our duty to be nonsensical
				and ridiculous at times, for the entertainment of the rest of the world. If we are never to
				open our mouths until the unsealing of the aperture is to give evidence of a present Solomon,
				and to add something to the Book of Proverbs, we must for the most part, stand like
				the statue of Harpocrates, with &#8216;Still your finger on your lips, I pray.&#8217; If we do speak,
				under such restrictions, it cannot well be, as the world is constituted, more than once or
				twice in the course of an existence, the rest of the sojourn upon earth being devoted to a
				sublimation of our thought. But always wise, sensible, sagacious, rational; always in wig
				and spectacles; always algebraic and mathematical; doctrinal and didactic; ever to sit
				like <span class="special_name">Franklin&#8217;s</span> portrait, with the index fixed upon &#8216;causality;&#8217; one might as well be a
				petrified &#8216;professor,&#8217; or a <span class="special_name">William Penn</span> bronzed upon a pedestal. There is nothing so
				good, either in itself or in its effects, as good nonsense.&#8217; Upon reading the foregoing, we
				laid Mr. <span class="special_name">Yellowplush&#8217;s</span> &#8216;flattering function&#8217; to our soul, that after all, we need not
				greatly distrust the reception of our monthly salmagundi, since one good producer and
				critic may be held as in some sort an epitome of the public; and especially, since any one
				subsection of our hurried Gossip, should it chance to be dull, or void of interest, may be
				soon exhausted, or easily skipped. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> We observed lately, in the pages of a monthly
				contemporary, an elaborate notice of the poems of <span class="special_name">Alfred Tennyson</span>, who has written
				many somewhat affected and several very heartful and exquisite verses; and were not a
				little surprised to find no reference to two of the most beautiful poems in his collection;
				namely, the &#8216;New-Year&#8217;s Eve,&#8217; and its &#8216;Conclusion.&#8217; The first embodies the reflections
				of a young maiden, sinking gradually under that fell destroyer, <span class="special_name">Consumption</span>. It is new-year&#8217;s
				eve, and she implores her mother to &#8216;call her early,&#8217; that she may see the sun rise
				upon the glad new year, the last that she shall ever see. How touchingly the associations

				<p><span class="first_word">We</span> are indebted to a friend and correspondent at the Phillippine Islands, for two very
				instructive and amusing volumes, of which we intend the reader shall know more hereafter.
				The first is entitled &#8216;<i>Portfolio Chinensis</i>,&#8217; or a collection of authentic Chinese State
				Papers, in the native language, illustrative of the history of the late important events in
				China, with a translation by J. <span class="special_name">Lewis Shuck</span>; the second, a &#8216;<i>Narrative of the late Proceedings
				and Events in China</i>,&#8217; by <span class="special_name">John Slade</span>, editor of the &#8216;Canton Register.&#8217; In looking
				over these publications, we are struck with the vigor and pertinacity with which, when
				once their minds were made up, the Chinese authorities pursued their object of abolishing
				opium forever from the celestial empire. Edicts against the &#8216;red-bristled foreigners&#8217; from
				England, and the people of the American or &#8216;flower-flag nation,&#8217; who should hoard up the
				smoking earth or vaporous drug, were enforced by others addressed to the natives, intended
				to lessen or annihilate the demand. The remonstrances with the opium-smokers
				themselves are exceedingly pungent. The &#8216;Great Emperor, quaking with wrath,&#8217; having
				examined the whole matter, and &#8216;united the circumstances,&#8217; saturates the High Commissioner
				<span class="special_name">Lin</span> with his own bright &#8216;effulgence of reason,&#8217; who thereupon promulges: &#8216;Although
				the opium exists among the outside barbarians, there is not a man of them who is
				willing to smoke it himself; but the natives of the flowery land are on the contrary with
				willing hearts led astray by them; and they exhaust their property and brave the prohibitions,
				by purchasing a commodity which inflicts injury upon their own vitals. Is not
				this supremely ridiculous! And that you part with your money to poison your own selves,
				is it not deeply lamentable! How is it that you allow men to befool you? Thus the fish
				covets the bait and forgets the hook; the miller-fly covets the candle-light, but forgets the
				fire. Ye bring misfortunes upon yourselves! Habits which are thus disastrous are unchangeable,
				being like the successive rolling of the waves of the sea. Is not your conduct
				egregiously strange? We the governor and Fooyuen have three times and five times
				again and again remonstrated with and exhorted you, giving you lucid warning. Surely,
				you are indeed dreaming, and <em>snoring</em> in your dreams!&#8217; These multiplied edicts, and the
				offers of <em>rewards</em>, to &#8216;encourage repentant and fear-stricken hearts,&#8217; seem to have led to a
				little trickery on the part of certain cunning mandarins, if we interpret aright this clause
				in an ensuing &#8216;lucid warning:&#8217; &#8216;The opium-pipes which are delivered up must be distinguished
				clearly as to whether they are real or false. Those having on the outside of
				them the marks of use, and within the oily residue of the smoke, are the genuine ones;
				and those which are made of new bamboo, and merely moistened with the smoky oil, are
				the false ones.&#8217; A &#8216;spec.&#8217; had evidently been made by means of false &#8216;smoking-implements.&#8217;
				But the most amusing portions of these volumes are the vermillion edicts against
				the &#8216;outside barbarians,&#8217; who had irritated the sacred wrath to the cutting off of their
				trade. The estimates of the Fooyuen, it will be seen, are of that vague kind usually
				designated among us as &#8216;upward of considerable.&#8217; Alluding to the &#8216;blithesome profits&#8217;
				which had accrued from an intercourse with China, he says: &#8216;I find that during the last
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>294</span>several tens of years the money out of which you have duped our people, by means of
				your destructive drug, amounts I know not to how many tens of thousands of myriads.
				Your ships, which in former years amounted annually to no more than several tens, now
				exceed a hundred and several tens, which arrive here every year. I would like to ask
				you if in the wide earth under heaven you can find such another profit-yielding market as
				this is? Our great Chinese Emperor views all mankind with equal benevolence, and therefore
				it is that he has thus graciously permitted you to trade, and become as it were steeped
				to the lips in gain. If this port of Canton, however, were to be shut against you, how
				could you scheme to reap profit more? Moreover, our tea and rhubarb are articles which
				ye foreigners from afar cannot preserve your lives without; yet year by year we allow
				you to export both beyond seas, without the slightest feeling of grudge on our part. Never
				was imperial goodness greater than this! Formerly, the prohibitions of our empire might
				still be considered indulgent, and therefore it was that from all our ports the sycee leaked
				out as the opium rushed in: now, however, the Great Emperor, on hearing of it, actually
				quivers with indignation, and before he will stay his hand the evil must be completely and
				entirely done away with.&#8217; But these denunciations are not unmingled with incitements to
				fear in another direction: &#8216;You are separated from your homes by several tens of thousands
				of miles, and a ship which comes and goes is exposed to the perils of the great and
				boundless ocean, arising from curling waves, contrary tides, thunders and lightnings, and
				the howling tempest, as well as the jeopardy of crocodiles and whales! Heaven&#8217;s chastisements
				should be regarded with awe. The majesty and virtue of our Great Emperor is
				the same with that of heaven itself! Our celestial dynasty soothes and tranquillizes the
				central and foreign lands, and our favor flows most wide. Our central empire is exuberant
				in all kinds of productions, and needs not in the slightest degree whatever the goods of the
				outer seas.&#8217; As matters are about proceeding to an open rupture with the &#8216;red-bristled
				foreigners,&#8217; and preparations are making to &#8216;fire upon them with immense guns,&#8217; there
				ensues a bit of Chinese diplomacy, which is especially rich. After a long interview by a
				committee with the <i>Chefoo</i>, during which all sorts of arguments are urged upon Snow, the
				American Consul, and <span class="special_name">Van Basel</span>, the Netherlands Consul, to induce them to sign a
				&#8216;duly-prepared bond,&#8217; that none of their countrymen shall thenceforth bring opium to
				China, the audience is suddenly closed with: &#8216;To-morrow the Chefoo will be at the
				Consoo-house, and wait from nine till night to receive the bonds. <em>Now go home and go to
				bed!</em>&#8217; But enough for the nonce of <span class="special_name">John Chinaman</span>. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">In</span> alluding to Mr. <span class="special_name">Cole&#8217;s</span>
				graphic account of the <i>Ascent of Mount Ætna</i>, in our last issue, we spoke of its late eruption.
				While reading the proof of that portion of our &#8216;Gossip,&#8217; a friend handed us a letter lately received
				from an American missionary lady at the Sandwich Islands, from which we extract
				the subjoined vivid description of the great volcano at Hawaii: &#8216;You know,&#8217; says
				the writer, &#8216;something, I suppose, of the geological character of this island. It seems as
				though a vast crater had boiled over and poured its fiery liquid in every direction. This
				lava, having cooled and hardened, forms the basis of the island. The district of Kau is a
				rich, luxuriant spot, surrounded by desolate fields of scoriæ, which renders it difficult of
				access. We are situated six miles from the sea, sufficiently elevated to give us a commanding
				view of its vast expanse of waters. We can occasionally spy a sail floating like a speck
				on its surface. From the shore, the country gradually rises into a range of verdant mountains,
				whose summits appear to touch the clouds. Proceeding northward toward Hilo,
				there is a gradual rise, until you reach the Great Volcano, about six miles distant. In
				making the tour to Hilo, we camped here the second night, on the brink of the burning
				gulf. Suppose a vast area of earth, as large as the bay of New-York, to have fallen in to
				the depth of several thousand feet. At the bottom of this great cauldron, you behold the
				liquid fire boiling and bubbling up, partly covered with a thick black scum. There are
				two or three inner craters, which have been formed by the lava cooling on its sides while
				the liquid sunk below. The gentlemen mostly descended into this crater, but I was fully
				satisfied with a look from above. The earth is cracked all around at the top, and portions
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295"></a>295</span>of it are continually falling in. Steam issues from open places in all the region. This
				volcano has been in action from time immemorial, as the natives all assert, and has been
				with them an object of idolatrous worship. The range of mountains continues for some
				thirty miles beyond this, and terminates in the snow-capped summit of Mounadoa. This
				mountain is in full sight at Hilo, and about thirty miles distant. Since we have been here
				it has been the scene of the most wonderful volcanic eruptions ever yet seen on this
				island. <span class="keep_together">Mr. P&#8212;&#8212;</span>, in company with <span class="keep_together">Mr. C&#8212;&#8212;</span>, visited it a week or two since, and ascended
				the mountain to the old crater, from whence the flood of lava proceeded. Fire has
				not been seen in it within the remembrance of the oldest natives. An immense river of
				burning lava is at this time running down the side of the mountain, in a subterraneous
				channel, from three to four miles wide. They had a good view of it through air-holes in
				the lava, over which they were walking, which was like a sea of glass; frequently sinking
				in different places in consequence of the intense heat below. It will probably yet find its
				way to the surface somewhere, and, laying prostrate every thing that opposes it, pursue its
				devastating course to the sea. Truly we live in a world of wonders!&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">By</span> the by,
				speaking of volcanos: it will be remembered that in 1831 an island was thrown up by
				volcanic eruption in the Mediterranean sea, off the south coast of Sicily. It presented
				the form of a round hill, about one hundred and twenty feet above the sea&#8217;s level, with
				thick clouds of white smoke issuing from it. As may well be imagined, it excited great
				wonder and curiosity, and was visited by vast numbers of people. An Austrian, a French
				and a British vessel met there at the same time. A dispute arose as to what power the
				island should belong, what it should be named, etc.; when a British sailor leaped on shore,
				and planted on the topmost peak the union-jack. Nine cheers proclaimed Britannia victorious.
				On returning shortly after, to take another look at their newly-acquired possession,
				they found to their dismay that, like Aladdin&#8217;s palace, the island had disappeared, leaving
				the Mediterranean as smooth as if the magic wonder had never reared its head! This
				circumstance suggested the following lines by a correspondent:</p>

				and pious hand-books for urchins of both sexes,&#8217; is not without humor, and ridicules
				what indeed in some respects deserves animadversion. We affect as little as our correspondent
				what has been rightly termed &#8216;a clumsy fumbling for the half-formed intellect, a
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296"></a>296</span>merciless hunting down of the tender and unfledged thought,&#8217; through the means of &#8216;instructive&#8217;

				and pathos of the <span class="special_name">Dickens</span> and <span class="special_name">Lever</span> school, there is something more of the Gothic and
				grotesque in their paintings than in these pure and unforced limnings of the able Frenchman.
				Where the ground-work of the tale is of sufficiently bold conception, and the incidents
				offer hooks enough to hang interest upon, there can be no doubt that this cool style is
				by far the most effectual in the end. The more strained and heated style of some other
				modern authors will be very effectual for awhile, but the excitement of the reader will
				flag sooner. The reason is, that too much descriptive and passionate power is expended on
				minor portions of the tale; and the enthusiasm of the reader is partially exhausted before
				he comes to the grand catastrophe, where it should be most of all elicited. But writers
				like <span class="special_name">Walter Scott</span>, or this Frenchman, are self-possessed and meditative in a great portion
				of their writings; by skilful touches giving the reader every thing necessary for him
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>297</span>to know in reference to characters and scenes; and on any great emergency their sudden
				heat carries the reader away captive.&#8217; The admiration expressed by our other accomplished
				friend for the chaste and graceful essays of a still more accomplished correspondent (there
				is nothing like disparagement in this comparison) is widely shared, as we have the best
				reason to know, by our readers on both sides of the Atlantic: &#8216;<span class="special_name">John Waters</span>! There is
				a drab-coated plainness about the name, which is at the same time <em>liquid</em> and musical; not
				more liquid and musical, howbeit, than those charming commentaries of his on every
				variety of quaint topic; full of an amiable grace, tinged with the most delicate hue of a
				fine humor; a refined ore drawn from no ordinary mine without alloy; like the compositions
				of <span class="special_name">Sappho</span>, to which an unerring critic has applied the expression, <span class="greek_text" title="chruseiotera chrusou">χρυσειοτερα χρυσου</span>;
				the very best of gold. Doves never bore choicer <i>billet-doux</i> beneath their wings. A beautiful
				sentiment always touches the heart, though couched in homely phrase; but when one
				knows how to cull from our mother-tongue the most expressive words, and has gained that
				enviable mastery, making them fall into their own places, and thus become inseparable
				from the idea, the perfection of art is gained. Serve us up these choice <i>morceaux</i> each
				month, dear <span class="special_name">Editor</span>; let them not be missed from the generous board, lest the banquet be
				incomplete. Let me tell you, in passing, that your correspondent <span class="special_name">Harry Franco&#8217;s</span> tale is
				a caution to dowagers. Never have I encountered such a startling incident on the high
				seas, out of &#8216;<span class="special_name">Don Juan</span>.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Did</span> it occur to &#8216;N.&#8217; that the change suggested in the
				mere inscription of his epigram, &#8216;<i>Religious Disputation</i>,&#8217; would be entirely out of keeping?
				&#8216;Uniting the circumstances,&#8217; as Commissioner <span class="special_name">Lin</span> would say, would produce such discrepancy
				as was occasioned lately at a democratic meeting in one of the western States, where
				a certain resolution in favor of our old friend and correspondent, Gen. <span class="special_name">Cass</span>, was made to
				undergo a slight metamorphosis by the substitution of the name of Mr. <span class="special_name">Van Buren</span>;
				causing it to read something like this: &#8216;Whereas Gen. <span class="special_name">Martin Van Buren</span> emigrated to
				the west from New-Hampshire in early life with his knapsack on his back, and unsheathed
				his sword in repelling the Indians and fighting against the British!&#8217; etc. This historical
				fiction, in the antagonistic excitement of the moment, was carried by an almost unanimous
				vote! <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Inversion</span> of mere words, or involution of phrase and syntax, let
				us whisper in the ear of our Troy correspondent, is not a very great beauty in poetry. His
				own good thoughts are spoiled by this affectation. It requires an artist to employ frequent
				inversion successfully. The opening of the &#8216;<i>Lines on a Bust of Dante</i>&#8217;, by Mr.
				<span class="special_name keep_together">T. W. Parsons</span>, affords a pleasing example in this kind. It is clear and musical:</p>

				<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">See</span> from this counterfeit of him</p>
				<p class="i2">Whom Arno shall remember long,</p>
				<p><em>How stern of lineament, how grim</em></p>
				<p class="i2"><em>The father was of Tuscan song.</em>&#8217;</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<p>Inversion should be naturally suggested, not forced. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">It</span> is to be inferred, we fear,
				that the late &#8216;principal editor&#8217; of the &#8216;<i>Brother Jonathan</i>&#8217; does not take it in good part that
				the new proprietors of that now popular journal saw fit to arrest its rapid decadence, by a
				removal of the inevitable cause of such a consummation. Lo! how from his distant down-east
				ambush, with characteristic phrase, he denounces them as &#8216;cowards&#8217; and &#8216;puppies!&#8217;
				Whereupon, in a response appropriately brief, the &#8216;brave few&#8217; of the &#8216;principal editor&#8217;s&#8217;
				old readers who have &#8216;endured unto the end,&#8217; are informed by the new incumbent, that
				the tabooed ci-devant functionary &#8216;seems disturbed because he was not suffered to kill the
				&#8216;Brother Jonathan&#8217; as he had killed every journal in which he was permitted to pour out
				his vapid balderdash. He is a perfect <span class="special_name">Bluebeard</span> among newspapers. He no sooner
				slaughters one, than he manages to get hold of another, and butcher that with the same
				remorseless indifference.&#8217; The editor adds: &#8216;He once enjoyed the honor of some connection
				with the &#8216;New World,&#8217; and would have consigned that well-known sheet to the
				tomb of the Capulets, had not the publishers foreseen the danger, and escaped in season.&#8217;
				We merely note these facts, as corroborative of a remark or two of our own, in our last
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>298</span>issue. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> &#8216;<i>An Incident in Normandy</i>&#8217;, we shrewdly suspect, is <em>not</em> &#8216;from the French;&#8217;
				if it be, all that we have to say is, that such pseudo-rhapsodists as the writer could never
				by any possibility <em>love</em> nature. The thing is altogether <em>over-done</em>. A Frenchman&#8217;s opinion,
				however, <span class="special_name">Cowell</span> tells us, should never be taken where the beauties of nature are concerned,
				<em>unless they can be cooked</em>. There is another grave objection to the article; which
				consists in the undue frequency of Italian and French words and phrases, foisted into the
				narrative. We have a strong attachment to plain, perspicuous <em>English</em>. Ours is a noble
				language, a beautiful language; and we hold fully with <span class="special_name">Southey</span>, who somewhere remarks
				that he can tolerate a Germanism, for family sake; but he adds: &#8216;He who uses a Latin
				or a French phrase where a pure old English word does as well, ought to be hung, drawn
				and quartered, for high treason against his mother-tongue.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> &#8216;<i>The Song of the New
				Year</i>, by Mrs. <span class="special_name">Nichols</span>, in a late number,&#8217; writes a Boston correspondent, &#8216;is an excellent
				production, and a fair specimen of the improved style of our occasional American verse.
				Suppose a book-worm should light on poetry of equal merit among <span class="first_word">Flatman&#8217;s</span>, <span class="first_word">Falconer&#8217;s</span>,
				<span class="first_word">Prior&#8217;s</span>, or <span class="special_name">Parsell&#8217;s</span> collections? Would it not shine forth, think you? Indeed
				our lady-writers are wresting the plume from our male pen mongers unco fast.&#8217; &#8216;That&#8217;s
				a fact.&#8217; Mrs. <span class="special_name">Nichols</span> has a sister-poet at Louisville, Kentucky, who has a very charming
				style and a delicious fancy. A late verse of hers in some &#8216;<i>Lines to a Rainbow</i>,&#8217; signed
				&#8216;<span class="special_name">Amelia</span>,&#8217; which we encountered at a reading-room the other day, have haunted our

				from these inscriptions, could mean. It was the name of the great Hong merchant, &#8216;the
				friend of Americans,&#8217; who died recently at Canton, at an advanced age, leaving his vast
				wealth to two sons. Here is an elegy written upon his death by his brother-merchant

				<div class="quotation">

					<p><span class="first_word">I weep</span> for <span class="special_name">Howqua</span>. He was the friend of my youth. We often rose before day-break, and
					gazed together at the soft blue clouds round the retiring moon.</p>

					<p>At that time I smiled on <span class="special_name">Howqua</span>. We both grew old together. We often went to the tombs of
					our fathers, side by side, and thought tenderly of the loving dead.</p>

					<p>Weep friends of the Hong. All friends at home (literally <i>Celestial</i> friends,) and all natives of outside
					countries weep; weep excessively. For <span class="special_name">Howqua</span> is no more.</p>

					<p><span class="special_name">Howqua</span> was a fixed man. He had reason. Loving old laws, old customs, and all things long
					since established as wise, he therefore hated change.</p>

					<p><span class="special_name">Howqua</span> was very rich. He had no half-thinkers and third-smokers (meaning <i>no partners</i>,) and
					no branch-breakers to his universal tea-dealings.</p>

					<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>299</span>Also he had lands for rice and pasture, and to play at ball, and villas, and ponds of fish, and fifteen
					field-bridges of carved wood gilt, and seven domestic bridges inlaid with ivory birds and dragons.</p>

					<p>Also he had money in the foreign mysteries (probably meaning the <i>funds</i>.)</p>

					<p>Also he had doings with several things of great value, and shares of large ship-loads. But never
					would he touch the hateful opium-trade, after the recent mad insolences.</p>

					<p>Also he had some wives.</p>

					<p>Also the <span class="special_name">Great Emperor</span> loved him, though <span class="special_name">Howqua</span> was only as the poorest man before that
					Yellow Illumination of our day and night.</p>

					<p>The body of my friend was slight, and easily injured; like the outside of people&#8217;s pocket-watch
					when she walk against the sun (that is, an injured watch that <i>goes wrong</i>.) But my dear friend for
					whom I shed these tears had a head with many eyes.</p>

					<p><span class="special_name">Howqua</span> knew what to do with his unnecessary gold. He built a temple to Buddha, and thus made
					the god a present of 2,000,000 dollars, to the excessive delight of his Essence and Image.</p>

					<p>Also, <span class="special_name">Howqua</span> gave 800,000 dollars to assist the ransom of his beloved Canton from the fangs of the
					late war; to the excessive delight of the Fighting-minded Barbarians.</p>

					<p>Weep, then, for <span class="special_name">Howqua</span>, even as I weep. He was the friend of my youth. Together we grew
					old, walking toward our fathers&#8217; tombs. We might have died together; but it is well that one old
					friend should be left a little while to weep.&#8217;</p>

				<p><span class="first_word">The</span> paper upon &#8216;<i>American Interior and Exterior Architecture</i>&#8217; we are quite certain
				would not have the tendency which the writer contemplates. It would discourage rather
				than foster that better taste which is gaining ground among us. In this city, how great
				have been the improvements in the exterior and interior decorations of our dwellings,
				within the last eight years! We remember the time as it were but yesterday, when the
				beautiful muslin window-shades, first introduced among us by Mr. <span class="special_name">George Platt</span>, were
				considered a luxury of interior decoration&#8212;as indeed many of them were. But from
				these small yet promising beginnings, our accomplished artist has gone on, until his extensive
				establishment is filled with specimens of rich and elaborate architectural decorations,
				for the various styles of which the reigns of French and English sovereigns have been
				put under the most liberal contribution. Our wealthy and tasteful citizens have vied with
				each other in the enriching and beautifying of their mansions; while, also emulous, a
				kindred class in our sister-cities have laid requisitions upon Mr. <span class="special_name">Platt&#8217;s</span> architectural
				and decorative genius, (for in him it <em>is</em> genius, and of no intermediate order,) which have
				convinced <em>him</em> at least, that the &#8216;laggard taste&#8217; which our correspondent arraigns, is &#8216;not

				<p><span class="first_word">There</span> is in these humane and benevolent days an increasing sympathy in the public
				mind for a man condemned to &#8216;march sorrowfully up to the gallows, there to be noosed up,
				vibrate his hour, and await the dissecting-knife of the surgeon,&#8217; who fits his bones into a
				skeleton for medical purposes. &#8216;There never was a public hanging,&#8217; says a late advocate of
				the abolition of capital punishment, &#8216;that was productive of any thing but evil.&#8217; There is
				an anecdote recorded of <span class="special_name">Whitfield</span>, however, which seems to refute this position, in at
				least one instance. This eloquent divine, while at Edinburgh, attended a public execution.
				His appearance upon the ground drew the eyes of all around him, and raised a variety
				of opinions as to the motives which led him to join in the crowd. The next day,
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>300</span>being Sunday, he preached to a large body of men, women and children, in a field near the
				city. In the course of his sermon, he adverted to the execution which had taken place the
				preceding day. &#8216;I know,&#8217; said he, &#8216;that many of you will find it difficult to reconcile my
				appearance yesterday with my character. Many of you will say, that my moments would
				have been better employed in praying with the unhappy man, than in attending him to the
				fatal tree, and that perhaps curiosity was the only cause that converted me into a spectator
				on that occasion: but those who ascribe that uncharitable motive to me are under a
				mistake. I witnessed the conduct of almost every one present on that occasion, and I was
				highly pleased with it. It has given me a very favorable impression of the Scottish nation.
				Your sympathy was visible on your countenances, and reflected the greatest honor on your
				hearts: particularly when the moment arrived in which your unhappy fellow creature was
				to close his eyes on this world forever, you all, as if moved by one impulse, turned your heads
				aside and wept. Those tears were precious, and will be held in remembrance. How different
				was it when the Saviour of mankind was extended on the cross! The Jews, instead
				of sympathizing in his sorrows, triumphed in them. They reviled him with bitter expressions,
				with words even more bitter than the gall and vinegar which they gave him to drink.
				Not one of them all that witnessed his pains, turned the head aside even in the last pang.
				Yes, there was one; that glorious luminary, (pointing to the sun,) veiled his bright face
				and sailed on in tenfold night!&#8217; <em>This</em> is eloquence! Would that we could have seen the
				beaming features, the &#8216;melting eye, turned toward heaven,&#8217; which indelibly impressed
				these words upon the heart of every hearer! <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Many</span> of our readers will doubtless
				remember the time when Professor <span class="keep_together">J&#8212;&#8212;</span>, the celebrated &#8216;artist in hair,&#8217; was flourishing
				in his glory, and when his fame was perhaps as rife in New-York and Boston as that of
				any man living, in his line of art. His advertisements too, so unique in their grandiloquent
				phraseology, will not soon be forgotten by those who relish such things. The Professor is
				not now, as regards worldly prosperity, the man he used to be; but his gentlemanly feeling
				still clings to him, and his pride in his profession is as enthusiastic as ever. We observe
				by a Boston journal that he is once more trying his luck in our eastern metropolis; and
				this reminds us of an anecdote concerning him. A friend tells us that some months since he
				encountered the professor at a coffee-house, where he was rehearsing to a rather verdant
				customer the former glories of his professional life. Among other things, &#8216;At one time,&#8217;
				said he, &#8216;I was sent for by express, to go to Philadelphia on professional business.&#8217; &#8216;To
				do what?&#8217; asked his listener. &#8216;To make wigs for the Signers of the Declaration of Independence!&#8217;
				replied <span class="keep_together">J&#8212;&#8212;</span>, with a pompous air. Now the professor&#8217;s comrade was not very
				quick-witted, as we have already hinted, and it did not occur to him at the moment whether
				the signers were men only of yesterday, or of the last century; and he rejoined, in a tone
				of wonder: &#8216;What! do they <em>all</em> wear wigs?&#8217; &#8216;<em>All?</em>&#8217; replied the professor, with a look of
				mingled piety and triumph; &#8216;why, Sir, did you ever know a wax-figure to wear its own
				hair? Men of flesh and blood, now-a-days, don&#8217;t know any better; but the <em>man of wax</em>,
				Sir, possesses a truer taste, and always consults the <span class="special_name">Perruquier</span>!&#8217; The relator says it
				would be impossible to convey an adequate idea of the superb manner in which the last
				word was uttered; the full round tone, and the tonsorial flourish of the right hand, as if
				it still grasped the magic brush and scissors. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">The</span> reader will have gathered from

				variety of season and changes of the hour, in executing his beautiful <i>Landscape Drawings</i>.
				We have neither the leisure nor space for an <em>adequate</em> notice of these pictures; but being
				solicitous that our town readers should participate in the great enjoyment which they have

				side-walk at the junction of White-street, his feet suddenly slipped from under him, his hat
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>301</span>flew forward with the involuntary jerk, and he measured his length on the side-walk,
				striking his bare head on the hard ice, till all rang again. At the instant it chanced that
				a lady and gentleman were just emerging from White-street into Broadway, and the prostrate
				sufferer, lying directly across their path, interrupted for a moment their farther progress.
				He soon recovered his feet, however, and with one hand on his newly-developed
				bump, and the other on his breast, he turned to the couple whose passage he had impeded,
				and exclaimed with cool gravity: &#8216;Excuse me; <em>I didn&#8217;t intend to do it!</em>&#8217; Probably he
				didn&#8217;t; at all events, his word was not disputed. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Most</span> likely our readers have not

				<p><span class="first_word">A friend</span>, in a recent letter to the Editor, thus alludes to the &#8216;<i>National Intelligencer</i>,&#8217;
				one of the ablest and most dignified journals in the country, and to two of its &#8216;special correspondents:&#8217;
				&#8216;Mr. <span class="special_name">Walsh</span>, who writes from Paris, seems an incorporation of European
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>302</span>literature and politics; and his articles are, in my belief, the most valuable now contributed
				to any journal in the world. Willis is the lightest and most mercurial &#8216;knight of the
				quill&#8217; in all the tournament. It is astonishing with what dexterity, felicity, and grace he
				touches off the veriest trifle of the day, investing the trite with originality, and giving the
				value of wit and poetry to the worthless and the dry. Pity that this brilliant &#8216;quid nunc&#8217;
				should degenerate into a mere trifling &#8216;<i>arbiter elegantiarum</i>,&#8217; and expend his buoyant and
				ductile genius in the indictment of ephemeral paragraphs. His genius, it is true, has little
				solidity; but if he would rest two or three years on his oars, he might collect the scatterings
				of wit and poetry, which would in that time accrue to him from his readings and
				reflections, into a volume of essays, etc., which would be inferior in brilliancy and piquancy
				to but few of any nation.&#8217; Possibly; but in the mean time, let us advise our friend, Mr.
				<span class="special_name">Willis</span> has the little substantials of every-day life to look after. He &#8216;pleases to write&#8217;
				frequently and <i>currente calamo</i>, because he &#8216;pleases <em>to live</em>.&#8217; Fame is one thing, and can
				be waited for; there are other things that cannot tarry so well. Mr. <span class="special_name">Willis</span> has &#8216;seen
				the elephant.&#8217; He knows that <span class="special_name">Kenny Meadows</span> is not far out of the way in his humorous
				picture of &#8216;<i>The Man of Fame and the Man of Funds</i>,&#8217; wherein a shadowy hand protrudes
				from cloud-land, holding a pair of steel-yards, to resolve the comparative weight of an
				appetizing leg-of-mutton, and a huge laurel-wreath. The mutton &#8216;has it&#8217; all to nothing,
				and the wreath &#8216;kicks the beam! <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="special_name">Punch</span>, up to the latest dates, suddenly makes
				his appearance in our sanctum. Merriest of Merry Andrews, he is ever welcome! His
				&#8216;<span class="special_name">Comic Blackstone</span>,&#8217; must be of great service to legal gentlemen. In it, among other
				things, we are enlightened as to the &#8216;<i>Rights of the Clergy</i>.&#8217; We subjoin a few items:
				&#8216;An archbishop is a sort of inspector of all the bishops in his province; but he does not
				call them out as an inspector would so many policemen, to examine their mitres, and see
				that their lawn sleeves are properly starched, before going on duty in their respective
				dioceses. An archbishop may call out the bishops, just as a militia colonel may call out
				the militia.&#8217; &#8216;A bishop (<i>episcopes</i>) is literally an overseer, instead of which it is notorious
				that some of them are overlookers of their duties, and blind to the state of their diocese,
				though they call it their see.&#8217; &#8216;The duties incumbent on a parson are, first to act as the
				incumbent, by living in the place where he has his living. Formerly, a clergyman had
				what is called the benefit of clergy in cases of felony; a privilege which, if a layman had
				asked for, he would have been told that the authorities would &#8216;see him hanged first.&#8217;
				&#8216;A curate is the lowest grade in the church, for he is a sort of journeyman parson, and
				several of them meet at a house of call in St. Paul&#8217;s Church-Yard, ready to job a pulpit
				by the day, and being in fact &#8216;clergyman taken in to bait&#8217; by the landlord of the house
				alluded to.&#8217; Concerning &#8216;<i>Subordinate Magistrates</i>,&#8217; as officers of the customs, overseers of
				the poor, etc., we glean the following information: &#8216;Tide-waiters are overseers of the
				customs duties, therefore it is their duty to overlook the customs. Custom is unwritten
				law, and a practice may be termed a custom when it can be proved to have lasted for a
				hundred years. Now, can any man doubt that the custom of defrauding the customs has
				endured more than a hundred years? Then the practice has become a law, and for
				observing this law, which, it seems, is one of our time-revered institutions, and a profitable
				proof of the wisdom of our ancestors, landing-waiters and tradesmen are to be prosecuted
				and punished. Monstrous injustice!&#8217; &#8216;Overseers of the Poor are functionaries who sometimes
				literally over-see or over-look the cases of distress requiring assistance. The poor
				law of <span class="special_name">Elizabeth</span> has been superseded by a much poorer law of <span class="special_name">William</span> the Fourth,
				the one great principle of which is, to afford the luxury of divorce to persons in needy circumstances.
				It also discountenances relief to the able-bodied, a point which is effected
				by disabling, as far as possible, any body who comes into the work-house. The Poor Law
				is administered by three Commissioners, who spend their time in diluting gruel and writing
				reports; trying experiments how little will suffice to prevent a repeal of the union between
				the soul and the body.&#8217; We have this information concerning the clock heretofore complained
				of: &#8216;<span class="special_name">Punch</span> has been accused of hitting this clock very hard when it was down;
				<span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303"></a>303</span>and it certainly must be admitted that it was wholly unable to strike in return. We are
				happy to say that the wound has been followed by the clock being at last wound, and
				we now offer to take it by the hands in a spirit of friendship. We have been told that
				the long stagnation has been caused by the absurd scruples of the pendulum, which refused
				to go from side to side, lest it should be accused of inconsistency.&#8217; Under the different
				months, &#8216;<span class="first_word">Punch&#8217;s</span> Almanack&#8217; gives many important directions, one of which is for the
				proprietors of the public gardens: &#8216;Now trim your lamps, water your lake, graft new
				noses on statues, plant your money-taker, and if the season be severe, <em>cut your sticks</em>.&#8217; The
				following &#8216;<i>Tavern Measure</i>&#8217; is doubtless authentic: Two &#8216;goes&#8217; make one gill; two gills
				one &#8216;lark;&#8217; two larks one riot; two riots one cell, or station-house, equivalent to five shillings.&#8217;
				For office-clerks, as follows: Two drams make one &#8216;go;&#8217; two goes one head-ache;
				two head-aches one lecture; two lectures &#8216;the sack.&#8217; To those gentlemen who are
				lovers of the Virginia weed in its native purity, a list of prices, &#8216;furnished by one of the
				first <em>Spanish</em> houses,&#8217; is published. It includes &#8216;choice high-dried dock-leaf regalias,&#8217; &#8216;fine
				old cabbage Cuba&#8217;s,&#8217; &#8216;genuine goss-lettuce Havana&#8217;s,&#8217; and &#8216;full-flavored brown-paper
				Government Manilla&#8217;s!&#8217; Two scraps under the head of &#8216;<i>University Intelligence</i>&#8217; must close
				our quotations: &#8216;Given the <em>force</em> with which your fist is propelled against a cabman,
				and the <em>angle</em> at which it strikes him; required the <em>area</em> of mud he will cover on reaching
				the <em>horizontal plane</em>.&#8217; &#8216;Show the incorrectness of using <em>imaginary quantities</em>, by attempting
				to put off your creditors with repeated promises to pay them out of your Pennsylvania
				dividends.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Many</span> German physicians and surgeons hold that there remains in the
				brain of a decollated head some degree of thought, and in the nerves something of sensibility.
				It is stated by his biographer, that in the case of Sir <span class="special_name">Everard Digby</span>, executed
				for a participation in the Gunpowder Plot, the tongue pronounced several words after
				the head was severed from the body. After the execution of <span class="special_name">Charlotte Corday</span>, also,
				it is alleged that the executioner held up her lovely head by its beautiful hair, and slapped
				the pale cheeks, which instantly reddened, and gave to the features such an expression of
				unequivocal indignation, that the spectators, struck by the change of color, with loud
				murmurs cried out for vengeance on barbarity so cowardly and atrocious. &#8216;It could not
				be said,&#8217; writes Dr. <span class="special_name">Sue</span>, a physician of the first eminence and authority in Paris, &#8216;that
				the redness was caused by the blow, since no blow can ever recall any thing like color to
				the cheeks of a corpse; beside, this blow was given on one cheek, and the other equally
				reddened.&#8217; Singular facts. Do they not militate against certain theories of &#8216;nervous sensation&#8217;

				the miserable compound itself, pray kill it dead in your Magazine! Hit it hard! By the
				by, talking of odd phrases, hear this. A young Italian friend of mine, fresh from Sicily as
				his own oranges, a well-educated, talented person, who has labored hard to get familiar

				I read him. I think he&#8217;s far more sorry than <span class="special_name">Petrarca</span>; don&#8217;t you?&#8217; This will remind
				the reader of the very strong term used by a Frenchman, who on being asked at a soirée
				what was the cause of his evident sadness, replied: &#8216;I av just hear my fader he die: <em>I</em> am

				&#8216;<span class="special_name">Green Josey</span>,&#8217; is to be seen in Newton, at the Herald office; though we cannot say that
				it speaks <em>any</em> language &#8216;passably.&#8217; It frequently makes the attempt, however, and here is
				one of its last &#8216;essays:&#8217; &#8216;Gov. <span class="special_name">Gilmer</span> is understood to have had a standing <span class="special_name">cart-balance</span>

				might be rendered by &#8216;unconditional offer,&#8217; is transmogrified into <em>cart-balance</em>! Among all
				the blunders perpetrated by conceited ignorance in its attempts to <em>parley-voo</em>, this stands
				unequalled. We have seen <em>hic jacet</em> turned into <em>his jacket</em>, in an obituary; that was a
				trifle; but <span class="special_name">cart-balance</span> overcomes our gravity!&#8217; So it does ours. The anecdote, to

					in every section of the United States. Their rich variety of subject; their alternate humor and
					pathos; the one natural, quiet, and irresistibly laughable; the other warm from the heart, and touching
					in its tenderness and beauty; won for them the cordial and unanimous praise of the press
					throughout the Union, and frequent laudatory notices from the English journals. Reminiscences of
					early days; expositions of the Ludicrous and the Burlesque, in amusing Anecdote; Limnings from
					Nature; and &#8216;Records of the Heart,&#8217; were among their prominent characteristics. It is not too
					much to say of the other Prose Writings which the volume will contain, that although of a somewhat

				carried away <em>both</em> houses, which was utterly in opposition to all Scripture. Part of the
				audience, said he, were asleep; and many of the rest so drowsy that, so long as one of the
				houses was taken off, the moral was enforced upon their perceptions as well by the one as
				the other. If he had made a <em>thorough</em> correction, he would have roused the attention of
				the whole parish, and nothing else would have been talked of for nine days. When a man

			<p>&#8216;<span class="ed_table_title">America Well Defended</span>&#8217; would not be inappropriate as a true designation of a beautifully
			printed pamphlet before us, from the press of Mr. <span class="special_name">Benjamin H. Greene</span>, Boston, containing a &#8216;Letter
			to a Lady in France on the supposed Failure of a National Bank, the supposed Delinquency of the
			National Government, the Debts of the several States, and Repudiation: with Answers to Inquiries
			concerning the Books of Capt. <span class="special_name">Marryat</span> and Mr. <span class="special_name">Dickens</span>.&#8217; We have read this production with warm
			admiration of its calm and dignified style, the grouping and invariable <em>pertinence</em> of its facts and arguments;
			and the absence of every thing which savors of <em>retaliatory</em> spirit, in its animadversions upon
			the misrepresentations of the United States by the English press. Expositions are offered of the
			character of the old United States&#8217; Bank, as contradistinguished from the &#8216;United States&#8217; Bank of
			Pennsylvania;&#8217; of the origin and nature of our public debts, national as well as of the separate States,
			etc. The themes of love of money, gravity of manners, of slavery, lynch-law, mobs, etc., are next
			considered; and the pamphlet concludes with some remarks upon the strength of our government,
			general results of our experiment, and our growing attachment to the Union. The author we understand
			<span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306"></a>306</span>to be Mr. <span class="special_name">Thomas G. Cary</span>, a distinguished merchant, who has brought the observation and
			knowledge of a <em>practical</em> life in aid of his reasoning, throughout his pamphlet. It has passed, we are
			glad to learn, to a speedy second edition; and we cannot but hope that it may be re-published in England.
			It could not fail to produce great good, in the rectification of gross errors in relation to this
			country.</p>

			<p><span class="ed_table_title">Parley&#8217;s Cabinet Library.</span>&#8212;In this work Mr. <span class="special_name">Goodrich</span> proposes to furnish the public with
			forty numbers, at twenty-five cents each, of biographical, historical and miscellaneous sketches, designed
			for the family circle, and especially for youth. The first two numbers consist of the lives of
			famous men of modern times; as <span class="special_name">Scott</span>, <span class="special_name">Byron</span>, <span class="special_name">Bonaparte</span>, <span class="special_name">Burns</span>, <span class="special_name">Burke</span>, <span class="special_name">Goethe</span>, <span class="special_name">Johnson</span>,
			<span class="special_name">Milton</span>, <span class="special_name">Shakspeare</span>, <span class="first_word">Bacon</span>, etc. The next two numbers are devoted to famous men of ancient
			times; as <span class="first_word">Cæsar</span>, <span class="special_name">Hannibal</span>, <span class="special_name">Cicero</span>, <span class="special_name">Alexander</span>, <span class="special_name">Plato</span>,  etc. The fifth and sixth numbers contain
			the &#8216;Curiosities of Human Nature,&#8217; as <span class="special_name">Zera Colburn</span>, <span class="first_word">Caspar Hauser</span>, etc. The seventh and
			eighth contain the lives of benefactors: as <span class="special_name">Washington</span>, <span class="special_name">Franklin</span>, <span class="special_name">Howard</span>, <span class="special_name">Fulton</span>, <span class="special_name">Bowditch</span>,
			etc. We notice also, in the biographical series, the lives of celebrated Indians and celebrated women.
			The historical sketches will present a series of striking pictures, illustrative of the history of the
			four quarters of the globe. The miscellaneous department will embrace arts, sciences, manners and
			customs of nations, a view of the world and its inhabitants, etc., etc. The intention of the author is
			to furnish a library of twenty volumes, devoted to the most interesting portions of human knowledge,
			with the design of rendering their subjects interesting and attractive to the general reader. Several
			of the numbers are now issued; and judging from these, we are happy to give the work our hearty
			approbation. The sketches will not be found to be <em>mere</em> sketches, drawn from cyclopedias: the author
			has evidently gone to the original sources, and culled with care the most interesting points on
			each subject. A contemporary expresses surprise that he has been able to say so much that is striking,
			just and new, in so brief a space; a praise in which we fully concur. The work entitled &#8216;Curiosities
			of Human Nature&#8217; is one of the deepest interest, and is calculated to suggest profound reflections as
			to the capacities of the human mind. The two numbers devoted to the American Indians, as well as
			other volumes, present a good deal of new and curious matter. The life of <span class="special_name">Jetau</span>, the Indian <span class="special_name">Voltaire</span>,
			is very striking. The Benefactors will be read with gratification by every one who loves to
			dwell upon the actions of those who have been great in doing good. The moral tendency of these
			works is excellent, and they may be read with pleasure as well as profit by old and young. They are
			happily adapted to the family as well as the school-library; and we are glad to know that they have
			been adopted for the latter purpose in some of our principal cities. They will constitute a wholsome
			check upon, as well as an agreeable substitute for, most of the trashy and pernicious literature that is
			now so freely poured upon the public. Mr. <span class="special_name">John Allen</span>, at the office of the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>, is
			the agent for this city.</p>

			<p>&#8216;<span class="ed_table_title">Wonders of the Heavens.</span>&#8217;&#8212;A superb large quarto volume has recently been put forth by
			Messrs. <span class="special_name">Robert P. Bixby and Company</span>, entitled, &#8216;The Wonders of the Heavens: being a Popular
			View of Astronomy, including a full Illustration of the Mechanism of the Heavens; embracing
			the Sun, Moon, and Stars, with descriptions of the planets, comets, fixed stars, double-stars, the constellations,
			the galaxy or milky way, the zodiacal light, aurora-borealis or northern-lights, meteors,
			clouds, falling-stars, aërolites, etc.; illustrated by numerous maps and engravings.&#8217; We cannot too
			highly commend this volume to our readers. The author, Mr. <span class="special_name">Duncan Bradford</span>, has kept constantly
			in view one object, viz: to make his subject plain and interesting to the people. Instead of
			mingling mathematics with his great theme, to such an extent as to alarm the neophyte at the very
			threshold of the temple of astronomy, he has with a wise judgment selected from the best works,
			including the latest, those parts that were least encumbered with the abstruse and the unintelligible;
			and the illustrations serve to make his sublime teachings still more clear.</p>

			<p><span class="ed_table_title">Rogers&#8217; Poems.</span>&#8212;We have not seen a more beautiful volume for a twelvemonth than the new
			illustrated edition of &#8216;Poems by <span class="special_name">Samuel Rogers</span>, with revisions and additions by the author,&#8217; recently
			issued by Messrs. <span class="special_name">Lea and Blanchard</span>, Philadelphia. It is indeed in all respects an <em>exquisite</em>
			work; being printed upon the finest drawing-paper, with a large clear type, and illustrated with ten
			engravings on steel, from paintings by the very first artists in England. The volume opens with the
			&#8216;Pleasures of Memory,&#8217; and contains every thing from the author&#8217;s pen which his maturest consideration
			has deemed most worthy of preservation. We cordially commend this admirable work to the
			attention of every reader of the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span> to whom it may be accessible.</p>
